// src/lib/routes.js  —  Phase 3.1: route map scaffolding
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Single source of truth for the view ↔ URL mapping. Used by the URL sync
// adapter in App (Phase 3.2) to write `view` state into the address bar and
// read it back on mount + on popstate (back/forward button).
//
// Nothing in here imports React or hooks — it's pure data. Safe to import
// from any module, including main.jsx at module scope.
//
// The `view` state machine stays unchanged. setView('X') is still the API
// every component calls. The URL just mirrors `view` (and vice versa on
// back/forward).
//
// 2026-05-06 public-URL rename:
//   - Public daily-reports hub canonical: /dailys (was /webforms).
//   - Public equipment/fueling hub canonical: /equipment (was /fueling).
//   - Internal logged-in Equipment module canonical: /fleet (was /equipment).
//   Old paths remain working aliases — see ALIASES_EXACT / ALIASES_PREFIX.
