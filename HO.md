# HO - Static Workflow SOP

Last updated: 2026-06-01.

This is the durable start-of-session workflow for Ronnie, CC (Claude Code), and
Codex. It is not a session log and must not carry current project state.

Current state, roadmap, architecture, contracts, and build history live in
[PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md).

Read order for every new session:

1. Read `HO.md`.
2. Read the relevant sections of `PROJECT.md`.
3. Inspect the repo before planning or editing.

Do not create extra handoff docs, session indexes, or archive notes unless
Ronnie explicitly asks.

Ronnie is using VS code for these sessions. CC is in the terminal and Codex is in the Chat window to the right. Ronnie has to copy and paste responses from Codex to CC and vice versa. In the Chat box Codex has the ability to put all reposnce to CC in a 1 click copy text box so Ronnie can make one click to copy and paste to CC. This is efficient. Apparently the terminla side of VS Code does not allow 1 click copy text box so Ronnie has to select all of CC's response and copy it to paste it in the chat to codex.

If CC or Codex have any sugeestion to make this more efficient and reduce Ronnie's key strokes or clicks then suggestions are welcomed.

Pushback is welcomed and encouraged. We want the best most professional build. We want to take the viewpoint of a world class developer and build the most robust logical planner based on logic and best practices. When either CC or Codex pushback they must state why and provide any source data of best practices in that push back.

## Doc Freeze Rule

During normal build, hotfix, review, and validation lanes, do not edit
`PROJECT.md`, `HO.md`, or docs files.

Docs may be updated only when Ronnie explicitly says one of:

- wrap
- docs
- session end
- update `PROJECT.md` / update `HO.md`
- a specific named doc change


---

## Roles

Ronnie is product owner and final decision-maker. Ronnie does not run tests,
migrations, `psql`, deploys, or PROD verification when CC has the access to do it. CC has CLI acces to supabase and must use it for anything that is can be used for.

CC is the primary builder. CC reads the lane context, edits files, runs
validation, applies approved Supabase work, pushes back on risk, and reports
results.

Codex is planning lead and reviewer. Codex scopes lanes, reads the repo/docs,
names contracts/files/tests/gates, reviews CC reports, and writes CC-ready
prompts.

Everything outside an explicit Codex edit request is Claude-owned by default.
Codex may edit docs/prompts/planning files when Ronnie asks.

---

## Authority And Gates

Ronnie alone approves commits, pushes, deploys, merges, destructive actions, and
production-impacting changes.

Gate approvals may be separate or bundled:

- If Ronnie approves one action, stop after that action.
- If Ronnie plainly approves a sequence, such as `commit and push`, `ship it`,
  `push it`, or `proceed with migration and bucket`, treat the named actions as
  approved and do not return for intermediate confirmations.
- If the approval wording is ambiguous, ask one concise clarifying question.
- Push to `main` implies Netlify production runtime change for code-only lanes,
  but Netlify auto-deploy does not require a separate confirmation loop by
  default. Codex does not verify push. The next build prompt is generated when
  Codex approves commit, not after push verification. When Ronnie reports that
  a push occurred, Codex should not verify it; Codex should only confirm or
  refresh the already-generated next prompt if needed.

Production gates:

| Action | Required gate |
|---|---|
| Push to `main` | Push approval, or explicit bundled commit+push approval |
| PROD `psql` migration apply | PROD apply approval, or explicit bundled approval naming the migration |
| PROD Storage bucket create/change/delete | PROD Storage approval, or explicit bundled approval naming the bucket action |
| Supabase Edge Function deploy | Deploy approval, or explicit bundled approval naming the function |
| Vault secret add/rotate | Vault approval, or explicit bundled approval naming the secret action |
| TEST DB migration apply | No separate gate inside an approved lane |
| Validation commands | No gate |

Lane approval can cover SQL writes, Vault checks, function deploys, and
migration applies inside that lane only when the approval says so. Commit, push,
deploy, merge, PROD migration, Storage, and Vault actions can be bundled only
when Ronnie's approval clearly names that sequence.

`exec_sql` in PROD is forbidden under every approval shape.

CC owns approved Supabase execution and verification. Do not route routine SQL,
migration applies, function deploys, Vault checks, or PROD verification back to
Ronnie when CC has the needed access.

---

## Git And Branches

Default branch names when a feature branch is used:

- `feature/<short-lane-name>`
- `fix/<short-bug-name>`
- `hotfix/<short-incident-name>`
- `docs/<short-doc-name>`

Do not rename/reorganize branches unless Ronnie asks.

If a PR exists, its body should hold the detailed build report. Chat summaries
stay short.

### Parallel Codex Worktree

A dedicated Codex worktree exists at:

`C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner-codex`

It is on branch `codex/parallel-worktree`, resynced to current `main`
(`af44459`) on 2026-06-04, with its own `node_modules`. This is the only Codex
worktree; the temporary per-lane worktrees from the 2026-06-04 ship
(feed/broiler/cattle) were pruned after their lanes merged. For a new parallel
lane, create a scoped `codex/<lane>` branch from current `main` in this
worktree rather than reusing a merged lane branch.

Default ownership is unchanged: Codex is still planning lead and reviewer, and
CC is still primary builder. Ronnie may explicitly assign a build lane to Codex
when parallel work would save time. Codex-owned build work happens in the Codex
worktree, not in the main CC worktree at `C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner`.

Parallel-build rules:

- Codex should create or switch to a scoped branch in the Codex worktree for
  each assigned build lane, such as `codex/<short-lane-name>`.
- Codex must check `git status --short`, recent git log, and sync/rebase from
  current `main` before starting a Codex build lane.
- Do not have CC and Codex edit the same files or same lane at the same time
  unless Ronnie explicitly coordinates it.
- Shared files such as route adapters, shared controls, test helpers,
  migrations, and config files require extra coordination before parallel
  edits.
- CC should double-check Codex-built work before Ronnie approves commit, push,
  deploy, merge, PROD migration, Storage, Vault, or other production-impacting
  gates.
- Gate rules are unchanged. A separate worktree is not approval to commit,
  push, deploy, migrate, merge, or touch PROD.
- Codex must clearly report when a result came from the Codex worktree and
  include branch/status, files changed, validation, risks, and requested gates.

---

## Session Start

Before planning or editing:

- Read `HO.md`.
- Read `PROJECT.md` Current State, Active Roadmap, and relevant Contracts.
- Run `git status --short`.
- Check recent git log.
- Inspect relevant source/test/migration files.

Codex must identify the working queue before planning: current lane, next lane,
paused work, open gates, hotfixes, known blockers, and dirty-tree risks. Use
`PROJECT.md`, git state, and source files; do not rely on chat memory alone.

If a lane touches a load-bearing contract, call that out before editing.

---

## Core Loop

1. Ronnie chooses the lane or question.
2. Codex investigates and writes a CC-ready plan or review.
3. Ronnie relays the `From Codex:` block to CC.
4. CC builds, validates, and reports back with `From CC:`.
5. Codex reviews and either pushes back or clears the next gate.
6. Ronnie approves or redirects one action or a named sequence, such as commit
   and push, deploy, merge, wrap, or next lane.

As soon as Codex clears a commit gate (`Ready to commit`, `Ready to commit and
push`, or equivalent), Codex must automatically include the next CC-ready build
prompt in the same response. Ronnie should not have to ask "next prompt" after a
commit approval.

The automatically generated next build prompt is queued behind the current gate.
It is not permission for CC to start that next build before the current commit,
push, or clean-checkpoint handling is complete. The prompt must say that
precondition clearly. If there is no safe next lane, Codex names the exact
blocker instead of inventing scope.

After Ronnie later reports a push, Codex does not verify the push. Codex should
only confirm or refresh the already-generated next prompt if project state or
Ronnie's direction changed.

Do not ask CC to choose the next scope.

If Ronnie has already approved the next action in a clear bundled sequence,
Codex provides the execution prompt instead of asking for another confirmation.

Keep a working queue during the session. Hotfixes may interrupt the queue, but
return to the paused lane afterward.

---

## Scope, Hotfixes, And Questions

Once Ronnie approves a build plan, scope is frozen.

CC/Codex may still push back if new facts show risk, bad assumptions, missing
contracts, or a better path. Product behavior, data model, permissions,
business workflow, and UI meaning changes go back through Codex and Ronnie.

Hotfixes stay small:

- Name the production symptom and affected surface.
- Identify whether source, migration, secret, deploy, or data action is needed.
- Avoid adjacent cleanup.
- Run focused validation plus any high-risk adjacent regression.
- Return to the paused lane after verification.

Ask only blocking questions. If the answer is in docs, code, schema, or prior
Ronnie decisions, use it and state the assumption. If many questions are
needed, send one compact decision packet with recommended defaults.

---

## Relay Format

CC updates intended for Codex start with:

`From CC:`

Codex prompts or reviews intended for CC start with:

`From Codex:`

Use those prefixes exactly. Inside copyable relay blocks, keep content plain
text. Avoid Markdown backticks around file paths, route names, function names,
commands, or commit subjects so Ronnie can paste the block cleanly.

Every CC-ready `From Codex:` prompt must be placed in one single copyable text
box/code block so Ronnie can copy the whole prompt with one click. Keep the
content inside the block as plain text; do not use Markdown formatting inside
the relay text.

When a Codex response contains both a current gate prompt and a queued next
build prompt, treat them as two separate CC prompts. Each prompt gets its own
single copyable `From Codex:` block unless Codex intentionally combines them
into one clearly sequenced relay. Do not split one prompt across multiple
blocks.

If CC or Codex disagrees, state:

- Concrete risk.
- Recommended path.
- What proof would settle it.

Then Ronnie decides.

---

## Required CC Build Summary

Chat-side `From CC:` should be summary-first and short enough for one-glance
review. Include:

- Branch/working-tree state.
- One-line purpose.
- Files changed.
- What changed.
- Validation results.
- Skipped validation and residual risk.
- Migration/schema/RLS/storage/deploy impact.
- Known risks and excluded scope.
- Requested gates.

Detailed RPC contracts, exhaustive verification notes, and long implementation
reports belong in the PR body or a clearly separated appendix, not the main
chat block.

---

## Required Codex Prompt

A CC-ready `From Codex:` prompt should include:

- Goal.
- Scope and out-of-scope.
- Relevant `PROJECT.md` contracts.
- Likely files/areas touched.
- Product, UX, permission, and data-model decisions.
- Required validation.
- Commit/push/deploy/doc gates, including whether current approval bundles any
  of them.
- Open blockers, if any.

Prompts should be copyable and direct. Put the entire `From Codex:` relay in
one copyable text box/code block; do not split one CC prompt across multiple
blocks.

When Codex approves commit, the response must also include the queued next build
prompt. The queued prompt must include its precondition, such as "start only
after the current checkpoint is committed/pushed or the working tree is clean."

---

## Review Outcomes

Use these outcomes when possible:

- `Blocked` - prerequisite or major design issue.
- `Needs fixes` - close, but changes are required before the next gate.
- `Ready for next checkpoint` - checkpoint is clean; next build step can begin.
- `Ready to commit` - review and validation are clean for commit approval; Codex
  includes the queued next build prompt in the same response.
- `Ready to push` - committed work is clean for push approval.
- `Ready to commit and push` - review is clean and Ronnie has approved both
  actions in one bundle; Codex includes the queued next build prompt in the same
  response.
- `Pushed, next prompt confirmed` - push is reported complete; Codex does not
  verify push and either confirms the already-generated next build prompt or
  refreshes it if project state changed.

---

## Responsibilities

CC:

- Read relevant docs and files before planning.
- Walk touched load-bearing contracts.
- Keep edits scoped.
- Preserve unrelated user/agent changes.
- Use approved Supabase access instead of handing routine execution to Ronnie.
- Run lane-appropriate validation.
- Report files, gates, risks, skipped checks, and open questions.
- Do not update docs/wrap files unless Ronnie asks.

Codex:

- Do planning legwork before CC starts.
- Turn roadmap items into CC-ready prompts.
- Track queue, gates, paused work, and blockers.
- Review CC plans/build reports before gates.
- Push back on missed scope, unsafe order, weak tests, or contract drift.
- Keep CC-facing instructions concise and copyable.
- Automatically include the queued next build prompt whenever approving commit.
- Do not edit source files unless Ronnie explicitly authorizes it.

---

## Validation

Default code-lane floor:

- `npm run format:check`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
- Focused Playwright for the touched path.
- Adjacent regression Playwright when shared contracts are touched.

Docs-only changes may skip code tests when clearly disclosed.

Any skipped validation must state the reason and residual risk.

### PROD Migration Verification

After any PROD migration apply, CC reports:

- Precheck for fail-closed seed dependencies.
- Sequential `psql` apply against `PROD_DB_URL` with `ON_ERROR_STOP=1`.
- Post-apply verification for row counts, RLS, policies, RPC signatures,
  triggers, grants, and runtime impact where relevant.
- One-line PROD-impact statement.

Skipped checks must say what was skipped and why.

---

## Handoffs And Memory

If work pauses mid-build, CC leaves a compact `From CC:` status:

- Current branch/status.
- Completed work.
- Files touched.
- Validation already run.
- Next exact step.
- Blockers or decisions needed.

Do not assume Claude memory, Codex memory, or chat history is shared across
tools or sessions. Durable project truth goes in `PROJECT.md` only during
Ronnie-approved docs/wrap work. Current-session operational state can live in
chat.

---

## File Hygiene

Always check `git status --short` before staging, committing, or reporting a
clean tree.

Do not stage unrelated changes. Treat unexpected edits as user/agent work and
do not revert them unless Ronnie explicitly asks.

Prefer scoped staging by path. Do not stage generated reports, local env files,
or unrelated line-ending churn.
