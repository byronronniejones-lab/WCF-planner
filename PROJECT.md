# WCF Planner

Farm-management web app for White Creek Farm. React/Vite single-page app,
Supabase backend, Netlify production deploy from GitHub `main`.

This file is the durable project map: current state, architecture, roadmap, and
load-bearing contracts. Workflow, roles, gates, and relay format live in
[HO.md](HO.md). Do not turn this file into a session transcript.

Last updated: 2026-07-01.
Current wrap checkpoints: `1e8d58b` (PROJECT.md cleanup) plus `f32c2a1` (Cattle
Herds grouped-default / flat-controlled hotfix). Last code/product checkpoint:
`f32c2a1`. Previous newsletter checkpoint: `c668a2a` (PR #59, Newsletter
archive-link gating, migration `153`).
Shipped history lives in `git log` and `archive/SESSION_LOG.md`; durable behavior
lives in the Load-Bearing Contracts below; migration/live state lives in Current
State and Backend And Data State. Do not re-enumerate the changelog in this header.
Production URL: https://wcfplanner.com.
Netlify auto-deploys from GitHub `main`.

## Start Here

1. Read [HO.md](HO.md) for workflow, roles, gates, relay format, and
   parallel-worktree rules.
2. Read this file's Current State, Build Queue, and the relevant contracts.
3. Run `git status --short`, `git worktree list`, and inspect recent `git log`
   before planning or editing.
4. Inspect the source/test/migration files in scope before changing anything.

Default session model: Codex plans/reviews, CC builds/validates, Ronnie approves
commit/push/PROD gates. Ronnie may explicitly assign Codex build work; otherwise
CC is the primary builder.

## Project Map Governance

This file is a docs-as-code project map, not a session log, scratchpad, or
append-only changelog.

Rules for editing this file:

- Build Queue is the only home for outstanding build/design work. Do not hide
  "future", "needs", "still needs", "TODO", or "TBD" work in later sections.
- Contract sections describe current architecture, standards, and guard rails.
  If a contract is aspirational rather than true, move the work to Build Queue
  and state the current guard/inventory honestly.
- Current State summarizes what is true now, including active local worktree risk
  when it matters. Recent Shipped Checkpoints summarize work merged to
  `origin/main`.
- Inventory counts, migration state, test names, and owner lists must match the
  source/static guards at the time of edit. Prefer pointing to the guard as the
  source of truth instead of duplicating fragile counts.
- Every Build Queue item should state class (`DEFECT`, `DECISION`, `ENH`),
  scope, success criteria, validation/guard target, and any migration/PROD gate
  once it is promoted into an active lane.
- Remove or reconcile stale text instead of appending corrections nearby.
- Normal build/hotfix lanes must not edit this file unless Ronnie explicitly
  requests docs, wrap, or a named `PROJECT.md` change.

Design/function invariants that govern cross-surface behavior live in
`## Global Decisions (Constitution)` and `## Design System`.

---

## Current State

- Production deploy: Netlify auto-deploys from GitHub `main`. This wrap merges
  the PROJECT.md cleanup (`1e8d58b`) and Cattle Herds hotfix (`f32c2a1`). The
  latest code/product checkpoint is `f32c2a1`.
- Newsletter live state: Autopilot + direction-first redesign + fact fixes +
  archive-link gating are merged (PR #44/#54/#55/#59). Migrations `146`/`151`/`153`
  are PROD-applied; `newsletter-harvest` is deployed (PROD v5 / TEST v1);
  `NEWSLETTER_AI_API_KEY` is a PROD-only Edge Function secret (TEST intentionally
  unset); the monthly cron is off. The public archive is link-gated by a rotating
  `?key=`. See the Monthly Newsletter contract for behavior and Build Queue item 1
  for the open first-issue / PROD-AI-smoke work. (Deploy version, secret presence,
  PROD migration apply, and published-issue/token counts are live state — see the
  live-verification note in the Supabase Migrations section.)
- Pasture Map live state: the pasture migrations `116`, `127`-`132`, `135`-`137`,
  `139`-`141`, `143`, `147`-`150`, and `152` are PROD-applied (`152` manager hard
  delete applied to TEST and PROD on 2026-06-30). Migration `150`'s `NOTIFY pgrst`
  line is text-only for future/fresh-env applies and was NOT re-applied to PROD
  (the function body was already live/verified). `/pasture-map` is an installable
  PWA hub; the service-worker cache version is `2026-06-30-pasture-pwa-v1`. Light
  has pasture farm-team-level Map/Field access (migration `139`). See the Pasture
  Map contract for UI/behavior rules.
- Migration high-water: migrations `112`-`116` and `125`-`153` are PROD-applied
  (live state; see Supabase Migrations for per-migration detail). Migration `143`
  remains deployed as a benign unused helper; no UI calls it.
- Production legacy import: `Processing Events - ALL.xlsx` upserted 69 rows into
  `production_legacy_events` on PROD by stable `source_key` (frozen historical
  count).
- Processing Calendar: planning locked, build NOT started. The single source of
  truth is Build Queue item 2; do not duplicate that plan elsewhere in this file.
- Processing status labels are normalized to `Planned` / `In Process` / `Complete`
  via `src/lib/processingStatusDisplay.js` (display-only; stored values are
  unchanged). See the Processing Calendar contract for the mapping and the
  pig-specific zero-head exception.
- Cattle Herds hotfix (`f32c2a1`): `/cattle/herds` defaults to grouped herd
  sections when no filters/search/non-default sort are active. Any active
  filter/search/non-default sort switches to one flat matched-results table.
  The `Sold` herd filter is sold-only and flat (no Processed/Deceased/Sold
  section headers). `Last Activity` sort/column uses the cattle animal Activity
  stream and shows date/time.
- `tasks-cron` Edge Function is active in PROD: recurring + system-task generation
  with batch/group entity labels, plus To Do approval/originator notifications.
- Broiler derived-data drift lane is closed and verified in PROD.
- Dependency hardening is complete: Vite/Vitest/plugin-react majors upgraded,
  SheetJS pinned to the patched 0.20.3 tarball, Node pinned to 22 for Netlify, and
  `npm audit` is 0 on the hardened lockfile.
- Worktree inventory: four worktrees — `C:/Users/Ronni/WCF-planner` (this docs
  lane, `docs/pasture-map-session-state`),
  `C:/Users/Ronni/WCF-planner-codex-cattle-herds-hotfix`
  (`hotfix/cattle-herds-activity-sort`, pushed and merged into this wrap branch),
  `C:/Users/Ronni/WCF-planner-newsletter-redesign` (`main`), and
  `C:/Users/Ronni/WCF-planner-codex-residuals` (still on the old
  `codex/persistent-login` branch; a merged lane, not a standing build worktree).
  The primary worktree keeps seven preserved untracked handoff/shot folders:
  `design_handoff_newsletter/`, `design_handoff_processing_calendar/`,
  `pasture-cp2-shots/`, `pasture-map-shots/`, `pasture-offline-field-guide/`,
  `pasture-open-line-edit-shots/`, and `pasture-rail-shots/`. Do not delete the
  preserved folders unless Ronnie explicitly asks.

### Recent Shipped Checkpoints

Per-PR shipped history is not maintained here. For what shipped and when, read
`git log` (every checkpoint hash resolves there) and `archive/SESSION_LOG.md`.
Durable behavior lives in the Load-Bearing Contracts below; current migration and
live state lives in Current State and Backend And Data State.

Most recent session: PROJECT.md cleanup (`1e8d58b`) plus Cattle Herds hotfix
(`f32c2a1`) on top of the Pasture Map field-tweaks trio (PR #56/#57/#58 —
Field-tab promote, tap-to-place draw, installable offline `/pasture-map` PWA;
migration `152` PROD-applied) and the residual-lanes closure (`1e7cab0`).

---

## Build Queue

Treat these as product lanes, not hotfixes, unless Ronnie says otherwise.
This is the canonical home for outstanding build/design work.

1. Newsletter first production issue + PROD AI smoke
   - Status: RELEASED TO `main` / SQL PROD-APPLIED / EDGE FUNCTION DEPLOYED.
     PR #44 (Autopilot) merged as `a1cdcf7`; PR #54 (redesign), #55 (fact fix +
     YoY), #59 (archive-link gating) also merged; migrations `146` -> `151` ->
     `153` are PROD-applied and verified; `newsletter-harvest` is active in PROD
     as version 5 (TEST v1). `NEWSLETTER_AI_API_KEY` is live as a PROD-only Edge
     Function secret, so Anthropic AI is available in production; TEST
     intentionally does not have the key. Cron remains off.
   - Class: `ENH`/`AI`/`DB-GATE`/`SECURITY`/`AUTOMATION`/`STORAGE`.
   - Product model shipped:
     - Gather this month's facts first: planner data only, no AI and no draft.
     - Ronnie steers: fact toggles, Monthly Q&A, tone, length/detail, and manual
       facts.
     - Write draft: AI writes from gathered facts + Ronnie direction and
       proposes a photo plan/shot list.
     - Revise draft: AI revises the current draft in place from an instruction
       while preserving the rest of the draft.
     - Photos: upload privately, approve/consent to public, assign to shot-list
       slots, place planned photos into the draft, choose cover, preview, and
       publish to public `/newsletter`.
   - Released surface: shipped as described in the Monthly Newsletter contract
     (migration `151` settings/coverage/photo-plan additions on top of
     `144`/`145`/`146`; shared parity modules + tests; the `newsletter-harvest`
     real-source harvest/coverage/revision/photo-plan/AI-probe support; and the
     redesigned admin 7-step tracker + public reader). Migration `144`'s
     exactly-three anon RPC surface remains the boundary.
   - Safety boundaries to preserve:
     - No finances or mortalities; births are born-alive; on-farm counts exclude
       dead/sold/processed animals at source; AI key stays server-only.
     - Structured-block whitelist only; renderer does not accept raw AI HTML.
     - Photo consent remains admin approval: private staging first, public copy
       only after approval.
   - Remaining actions:
     - Probe `newsletter-harvest` from `/admin/newsletter` or an approved admin
       call and confirm `aiConfigured: true` on PROD.
     - On the June (or first) issue, re-gather facts (picks up the v5
       broiler-processing fix) and Write/Rewrite the draft (appends the YoY
       production section), then verify the numbers + section.
     - Generate the first public archive link in `/admin/newsletter` ("Generate
       link"; or it auto-mints on publish), then share it; the archive is locked
       until a key exists.
     - Run the first production issue workflow: gather facts, review coverage,
       write/revise, approve/place photos, preview, publish, and verify the
       link-gated public `/newsletter` output. Cron stays off until separately
       approved.

2. Processing Calendar Asana import and native workflow
   - Status: PLANNING LOCKED / BUILD NOT STARTED. No schema/importer/UI work is
     approved yet. This Build Queue item is the single source of truth for the
     Processing Calendar build plan; do not duplicate the detailed plan in later
     sections. The 2026-06-27 planning session locked program sectioning, row
     identity, the streamlined 2026 field/dropdown set, template behavior,
     statuses, milestones, reconciliation, permissions, table/drawer behavior,
     comments, attachments, subtasks, Activity, and historical editability.
   - Class: `ENH`/`DB-GATE`/`SECURITY`/`STORAGE`/`DATA-IMPORT`.
   - Source/design: `design_handoff_processing_calendar` contains the prototype
     handoff, CSV, README, and support file. The CSV is not sufficient for
     import because comments, attachments, Asana gids, recursive subtasks, and
     reliable metadata require the live Asana API.
   - Verified live API checkpoint on 2026-06-26: project
     `1201484014160203` (`SF Processing Calendar ` with trailing space), 117
     top-level records, 5 top-level milestones, section counts Broiler 48 /
     Cattle 27 / Pig 29 / Lamb 13, 1,132 CSV subtask rows, 122 real comments
     on 52 top-level records, 71 attachments, and 0 live dependencies. The
     importer must self-audit current live counts at cutover; do not hardcode
     these counts as permanent truth.
   - Domain/source model:
     - Build a standalone Processing domain with its own tables and
       `asana_gid` provenance. Do not mutate cattle/sheep/pig/broiler source
       tables during import. Link to existing program records only when a
       confident match exists.
     - Treat the Asana import as one-time, idempotent, and re-runnable unless
       Ronnie explicitly asks for ongoing sync.
     - Use a server-side/service-role importer. Store the Asana token only in
       Supabase Vault. Preserve original timestamps and historical author
       display names. Suppress notifications during import.
     - Keep internal source/match provenance for idempotency, duplicate
       prevention, reconciliation reports, and debugging. Do not show provenance
       or import details in the normal drawer unless an admin/debug
       reconciliation surface is explicitly built later.
   - Record types:
     - `planner_batch`: real Processing row backed by a Broiler, Cattle, Pig, or
       Sheep workflow record.
     - `asana_historical`: imported Asana-only historical batch with no planner
       match. It is searchable/viewable but does not create animal batches
       inside the four program workflows.
     - `milestone`: manual placeholder for planning only.
     - `import_exception`: unmatched 2026 Asana row requiring Ronnie review
       before it can enter the normal planner.
   - Program and row identity:
     - The Processing table is sectioned by program. Program comes from Asana
       Section (`WCF Broiler Processing`, `WCF Cattle Processing`, `WCF Pig
       Processing`, `WCF Lamb Processing`) and from the owning planner program
       for native records. Do not add a separate future program dropdown. The
       Asana `Farm Programs` dropdown is imported historical snapshot data only
       if present.
     - Batch identity lives in the row/tile title. Do not add a separate future
       `Batch Name` custom-field column. Planner-owned rows show the owning
       program's batch id/name. Unmatched Asana-only historical rows show the
       imported Asana task name as their title. Preserve `Batch Name (Farms)`
       only in the historical snapshot if present.
   - Import/reconciliation rules:
     - Reconcile before importing rows. Every Asana top-level batch must be
       accounted for, but no duplicate Asana row should sit beside a
       planner-owned row.
     - High-confidence exact batch-id matches can auto-link. Fuzzy/uncertain
       matches go to review. Never auto-match across programs.
     - Primary match keys are program section plus normalized batch id/name.
       Supporting signals are processing date, year derived from processing
       date, number processed/count, `Batch Name (Farms)`, and task title
       fallback.
     - Store Asana gid, matched planner source type/id, match
       confidence/status, and match evidence internally.
     - 2026-and-forward real batch rows are planner-owned. Attach matching
       Asana comments, subtasks, attachments, and field snapshots to the planner
       row instead of creating a second row.
     - Pre-2026 rows that already exist in planner historical data stay
       planner-owned with legacy/historical snapshots. Do not force old records
       into the streamlined 2026 field framework.
     - Asana-only pre-2026 batches with no planner match import as
       `asana_historical` records.
     - Unmatched 2026 Asana rows are `import_exception` records for human review
       in the reconciliation report only. Ronnie must answer/resolve them in
       chat/review before they are put into the planner; do not silently create
       normal rows.
     - Subtasks attach inside their parent Processing record and never count as
       batch rows.
   - Streamlined 2026 fields/dropdowns:
     - `Processing Date` is the only date field in the 2026 UI. Real batch
       Processing Date is source-owned/read-only in Processing. Milestone
       Processing Date is editable. Preserve Asana `Start Date`, `Due Date`,
       `Planned Processing Date (SF)`, `Actual Processing Date (SF)`, and
       `Product Pick-up Date` only in historical snapshots when imported.
       `Product Pick-up Date` is nixed from the future framework.
     - `Status` is the uniform display vocabulary `Planned`, `In Process`, and
       `Complete`, backed by `processingStatusDisplay.js`; do not migrate raw
       program status values for this label change. Badge variants are
       `Planned` -> `warn`, `In Process` -> `ok`, `Complete` -> `neutral`.
     - `Processor` is a global controlled dropdown for all programs. Current
       default option is `Atlanta Poultry Processing`; admins/templates can add
       options later. Processor is optional for early planning but required
       before `Complete`. If an imported processor text does not match an
       option, preserve it and flag for mapping.
     - `Number Processed` comes from the owning batch/program data and is
       read-only in Processing. Do not create an editable Processing count
       field.
     - Broiler keeps `Customer` as a default controlled multi-select field with
       options `Sonny's`, `Coastal Pastures - CONFIRMED`, and
       `Coastal Pastures - POTENTIAL`. Template/admin can add Customer or
       similar fields to other programs later.
     - Broiler shows read-only `Time On Farm`, derived from
       `Processing Date - (hatch date + 1)`. `Farm Arrival Date` is Broiler-only
       context derived as hatch date + 1, not a global field.
     - Cattle, Sheep, and Pig show read-only Age when the owning program can
       derive it.
     - `Year` is not a field; derive year filters/sort from Processing Date.
     - Nixed future fields: program dropdown, `Batch Name` custom field, `Farm`,
       `Product Pick-up Date`, `Condemed`, `Status (Animal Master)`, main-record
       assignee/owner, stored `Time Remaining Until Processing`, Asana native
       `Start Date`, Asana native `Due Date`, and Asana formula fields except
       where replaced by derived Broiler Time On Farm or animal Age.
   - Status and completion semantics:
     - Broiler displays `Planned` until hatch/start, `In Process` while birds
       are in the batch/on farm, and `Complete` after processing.
     - Cattle displays planned reservations/forecast rows as `Planned`,
       Send-to-Processor attached cattle as `In Process`, and
       hanging-weights/Mark Complete rows as `Complete`.
     - Pig raw `active` displays `Planned` when started/current head are both
       zero and `In Process` once pigs exist in the workflow; `processed`
       displays `Complete`.
     - Sheep currently uses `Planned` and `Complete`; no explicit sheep
       in-process source state is locked yet.
     - A Processing record cannot be marked `Complete` unless Processor is
       selected, Processing Date exists, source-owned Number Processed/
       completion data exists where that program supports it, and all subtasks
       are complete. The UI must block completion and clearly list missing
       requirements.
     - Subtasks do not auto-complete the main record. Manual completion remains
       a separate status action, but incomplete subtasks block that action.
   - Milestones:
     - Milestones are manual planning placeholders, not animal batches. Ronnie
       manually deletes them when they are superseded. Do not build linking,
       auto-satisfaction, or conversion-to-batch logic.
     - Required milestone fields are program section, title, Processing Date,
       and default status `Planned`.
     - Milestones do not receive automatic subtasks or template checklists.
       Optional processor/customer/comments may be added manually if useful.
   - Templates:
     - Templates are per program and are admin-only to edit.
     - System/core fields cannot be deleted or broken by templates: row title/
       batch identity, program section, status, Processing Date, Number
       Processed/source metrics, Processor, source link/provenance, comments,
       attachments, Activity, and completion rules.
     - Template field and checklist edits apply to future records only by
       default. Existing records keep their field/checklist snapshots. Imported
       Asana records keep imported snapshots.
     - Existing records can receive current template additions only through an
       explicit action such as `Apply Current Template`. Applying a template
       adds missing current fields/subtasks; it does not delete imported/custom
       fields, imported/custom subtasks, or completed subtasks, and it does not
       auto-complete the main record.
     - Retired fields and retired dropdown options hide from future records but
       remain readable on records that used them.
     - Field type changes after records exist must be blocked or create a new
       version; do not mutate old values into a new incompatible type.
   - Subtasks/comments/attachments/Activity:
     - Main-record assignee/owner is nixed. Assignees live only on subtasks.
       Import Asana task-level assignee as historical snapshot/provenance only.
     - Subtasks keep label/name, assignee, completion state, and relevant API
       date/completion metadata. Recursively fetch subtasks; flatten nested
       subtasks for v1 unless Ronnie asks for nested checklist UI.
     - Import real Asana comments into the normal Comments thread and mark them
       `Imported from Asana`. Preserve original author display name and
       timestamp. Do not import Asana system activity/stories, field-change
       logs, likes, follower/rule events, or automation noise.
     - All Asana attachments must transfer. Copy bytes into WCF/Supabase
       Storage; do not rely on Asana links. Preserve filename, size/content type
       if available, Asana attachment gid, linked record, and original timestamp
       when available. Attachments belong to the Processing record for v1.
     - Native WCF Activity starts after cutover and logs everything: created,
       status changes, blocked completion attempts where useful, field changes,
       template application, subtask add/rename/complete/reopen/reassign/delete,
       attachment add/remove, milestone create/delete, and comment changes if
       comment editing exists.
   - Editability and permissions:
     - Light users have no Processing Calendar access.
     - Admin has full access including template editing.
     - Management and Farm Team have the same operational permissions and no
       template editing: view/open drawers, edit operational Processing-owned
       fields, create/delete milestones, mark complete/reopen subject to
       completion rules, manage/reassign subtasks, comment, upload/remove
       attachments, and apply current templates to existing records.
     - Real planner-owned Processing records cannot be deleted from Processing.
       Milestones can be deleted by Admin, Management, and Farm Team. Imported
       historical records should not be casually deleted; prefer archive/hide,
       with hard delete admin-only if ever added.
     - Pre-2026 records are historical/read-only except comments. Imported
       snapshots, fields, subtasks, and source facts stay locked.
     - 2026-and-forward records use field-based editability: source-owned facts
       are read-only; Processing-owned operational fields are editable by
       allowed roles; milestones are editable because they are Processing-owned.
   - Table, filters, and drawer:
     - Default view shows current year only, with a derived Year dropdown to
       choose prior years. Year is computed from Processing Date. Completed
       rows show by default and are designated by status badge/color.
     - Program sections are the primary table structure. Default sort is
       Processing Date ascending within each program section.
     - Useful filters/search: year, status, processor, Broiler customer, record
       type, show/hide completed, and batch/title search.
     - Default table row fields: batch/title, status, Processing Date,
       Processor, Number Processed/source count metric, Customer in Broiler
       only, Broiler Time On Farm or Cattle/Pig/Sheep Age, and simple subtask
       count such as `6/10`. Do not show attachment or comment indicators in
       the table.
     - No inline table edits. Rows open the drawer.
     - Drawer is required and is where editing/details live. Drawer shows
       header/title/status, current fields, derived/source data, subtasks,
       comments, attachments, and Activity. 2026-and-forward drawers show only
       the current streamlined field framework. Historical/imported pre-2026
       drawers may show historical/imported field snapshots.
     - Do not show provenance/reconciliation/import details in the normal
       drawer; keep that internal or in a future admin/debug reconciliation
       surface.
     - Preserve Asana transition familiarity: list/table feel, right-side
       drawer/panel record details, and the locked row hover/open affordance
       (lift, slight shadow, chevron). Conform to CP0/design-system contracts;
       do not ship flat background-only table hover.
   - Validation target: API dry-run inventory with live count reconciliation;
     TEST-only schema/import first; idempotent re-run proof; no duplicate
     planner-vs-Asana rows; imported task, field, subtask, comment, attachment,
     milestone, and author-display spot checks; static design/RLS/permission
     guards; focused browser coverage for list filters, record pages, comments,
     subtasks, templates, milestones, Activity, attachments, completion blockers,
     role permissions, historical lock behavior, and hover/openable table
     behavior. The importer must emit a reconciliation report with matched
     planner rows, Asana-only historical records, milestones, 2026 exceptions,
     duplicates blocked, and attached subtask/comment/attachment counts.
   - Gates: TEST migration/import may happen only inside an approved lane. PROD
     migration apply, Vault secret add/rotate, Storage bucket creation/change,
     Asana import cutover, Edge Function/deploy work if any, commit, push, and
     release are separate Ronnie gates. `exec_sql` in PROD remains forbidden.

3. CP5 forms pass (public webform island form styling)
   - Status: NOT APPROVED / NOT STARTED. Placeholder home for the deferred public
     `#webform-container` island form-styling pass. The island's own `--wf-r-*`
     corner radii and form tokens are intentionally still pending this lane (see
     Intentional Non-Uniformities and Design System > Radius, which point here).
   - Class: `ENH`/`DESIGN`.
   - Scope (unscheduled): align the webform island's form-control radii/tokens
     toward the CP0 section A3 floor without regressing the intentionally-separate
     island. Do not start without explicit Ronnie approval.

## Global Decisions (Constitution)

The following decisions are locked and govern future builds. New code and
surface changes MUST conform unless this section is amended.

Rules:

- No surface may silently diverge from a locked decision. New exceptions MUST be
  added to `## Intentional Non-Uniformities` with justification.
- Changing any locked decision requires a Ronnie-approved amendment in this file
  and the relevant guard update in the same change.
- The entire `## Design System` section is part of the Constitution.

| Decision | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Font scale | Ratified; shared-token enforcement active, residual legacy drift only by scoped lane | `design_token_contract_static.test.js`, `record_page_shell_static.test.js` |

| Confirm/Delete stacking | Ratified; top destructive overlay tier | `design_token_contract_static.test.js`, `shared_ui_extraction_contract_static.test.js` |
| Button height/padding | Ratified; standard button pad `10px 16px` | `design_token_contract_static.test.js` |
| Save model | Ratified; submit-style vs autosave split | `save_model_contract_static.test.js` |
| Ordinary text hierarchy | Ratified; Home + parity + CP0 true-black sweep shipped | `homeRedesign.css`, `index.html`, `src/shared/DataTable.css`, `design_token_contract_static.test.js` |
| Design-law package (CP0) | Ratified 2026-06-16 (CP0-SIGNOFF A1-A12 + Tabs); compliance pass shipped 2026-06-18; deferred residual tails closed 2026-06-30 | folded into Global Decisions + Design System; `tests/static/non_pasture_residuals_static.test.js` |
| True-black text (CP0 section A1) | Ratified; `--text-primary`/`--ink`/island `--text` = `#000`; `getReadableText` exempt | `design_token_contract_static.test.js`, island/openable guards |
| One border gray (CP0 section A2) | Ratified; `--border` == `--border-strong` (one defined gray) | `index.html` token layer |
| Program-color tabs (CP0 Tabs) | Selected tab = filled pill in program color; unselected = plain text; header sub-nav adopts it; top green chrome stays | `Header.jsx` sub-nav + `Tabs.jsx`; `tests/static/non_pasture_residuals_static.test.js` |
| Closed badge set (CP0 section A4) | `ok/warn/danger/info/neutral`; <=1 per row; soft signals = colored text | `Badge.jsx`; broiler/pig/cattle batch static guards assert `<Badge>` adoption |
| One table system (CP0 section A6) | hairline rows, no zebra, right-aligned numbers, status as text first, whole-row openable | `DataTable.jsx`, `DataTable.css` |
| Color discipline (CP0 section A12) | program accent only on pill/dot/one-figure/brand-button; closed text-color set; species = dot + black label | dedicated guard in `tests/static/non_pasture_residuals_static.test.js` plus `design_token_contract`/`openable_hover` guards |
| Universal hover affordance (CP0 WI-6) | tile/card openables lift 3px/300ms + trailing chevron; table rows signal via wash + cell-border + chevron without `<tr>` transform; daily record lists use div-based `.hoverable-tile` cards to get the Home-tile lift | `openable_hover_affordance_static.test.js` |

Locked functional invariants:

| Invariant | Contract section | Guard |

## Intentional Non-Uniformities

These differences are current product/architecture decisions, not parity defects
unless Ronnie changes the contract:

- Light users are intentionally excluded from `/weighins` and `/production`.
  Light users have pasture farm-team-level access to `/pasture-map` (migration
  `139`): full Map + Field working controls, not a read-only/Map-only view.
- Light users may access Cattle Log through the webform/field-journal path.
- Migration `083` public webform submitter identity stays shelved. Authenticated
  submitter identity is the durable path.
- `/webform-pigs` remains a valid legacy standalone pig daily form route/alias.
- `egg_dailys` has warning/pre-submit duplicate prevention only; it is not
  covered by the daily unique-index backstop.
- Add Feed quick-log rows are not full daily reports, and missed-report checks
  exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Broiler, layer, and pig daily pages use Group copy rather than Batch copy.
- Pig planned-trip forecast weights are render-only. Latest weigh-ins do not
  change planned-trip forecast weights automatically.
- Program dashboards may show program-specific KPIs.
- The public `#webform-container` CSS island is intentionally separate from the
  React app tokens.
- The homepage redesign remains scoped under `.home.theme-crisp`; do not move
  Home-specific non-canonical micro-values globally without an amendment.
- The public `#webform-container` island adopts the CP0 section A3 10px radius floor on
  the app `:root` (`index.html`/`dailys.html`/`equipment.html` aligned 2026-06-17);
  the island's own `--wf-r-*` corner radii are pending the CP5 forms pass (see
  Build Queue item 3).
- CP0 section A12.1 permitted-uses are extended (2026-06-17) so the primary/brand button
  re-tints to the program color via `--brand` on each program's page wrapper; this
  is ratified, not palette drift.
- `getReadableText()` in `src/lib/styles.js` returns infrastructure contrast
  colors for arbitrary colored backgrounds; this is not palette drift.

---

## Product Surface

### Authenticated App

- Home dashboard: `.home.theme-crisp` landing surface with label-only program
  tiles, Pasture Map + Weather field row, Processing/Admin utility row, Animals
  on Farm, Production, missed-daily/equipment/material alerts, Next 30 Days, and
  admin Last-5-Days.
- `/animals-on-farm`: newest-first monthly species counts and multi-series line
  graph for Broilers, Layer Hens, Pigs, Cattle, Sheep, and Total. History range
  starts Oct 2024.
- `/production`: per-program production totals, per-program YoY, and production
  events. Internal reconciliation prevents double-counting historical backfill,
  but the visible page is production reporting, not audit/import review. No
  combined total ever.
- `/pasture-map`: field map/planning surface for OnX KML import, land-area
  review, classification, outline close, draw/edit/snap/measure, acreage
  display, GPS locate, NAIP imagery, move ledger/current occupancy, planned
  moves, rest/history/stocking reports, offline vector queue, GPS field tracks,
  and line-style/pattern controls.
- Broiler: home, timeline, batches, feed, dailys, weigh-ins.
- Pig: home, breeding, farrowing, breeding pigs, batches, feed, dailys,
  weigh-ins with table-based session records and Active/Complete list sections.
- Layer: home, groups, batches, dailys, eggs.
- Cattle: home, herds, breeding, forecast, processing batches, dailys,
  weigh-ins, Cattle Log.
- Sheep: home, flocks, processing batches, dailys, weigh-ins.
- Equipment/Fleet: `/fleet` with fleet list, fuel log, and equipment detail;
  `/equipment` remains the login-gated fueling/checklist hub.
- Task Center: `/tasks`, with To Do List at `/tasks/todo` and record pages at
  `/tasks/todo/<id>`.
- Light portal: contained home for `role=light`, allowed webform/daily
  shortcuts, Tasks, My Submissions/View Past Reports, equipment public hub, fuel
  supply, Add Feed, legacy pig daily, Cattle Log, and pasture farm-team-level
  Pasture Map (full Map + Field working controls, migration `139`). No Production
  or Weigh-ins.
- Global Activity: `/activity`.
- Admin/config: `/admin`.
- Admin runtime observability: `/admin/client-errors`.

### Login-Gated Form URLs

- Former public report/form URLs are authenticated. Existing paths and aliases
  stay valid, redirect logged-out users to login, and return to the requested URL
  after auth.
- `/dailys` and `/dailys/tasks`.
- `/addfeed`.
- `/weighins`.
- `/equipment` and `/equipment/<slug>`.
- `/fuel-supply`.
- `/webform-pigs`.
- Legacy aliases redirect through `src/lib/routes.js`.

### Operational Record Pages

Record pages are durable per-entity workspaces. They own record details,
Comments, collapsed Activity log, sequence navigation where appropriate, and
fail-closed loading.

Live Activity entity types and routes:

| Entity type | Route |
| --- | --- |
| `task.instance` | `/tasks/<id>` |
| `todo.item` | `/tasks/todo/<id>` |
| `cattle.animal` | `/cattle/herds/<id>` |
| `sheep.animal` | `/sheep/flocks/<id>` |
| `cattle.processing` | `/cattle/batches/<id>` |
| `sheep.processing` | `/sheep/batches/<id>` |
| `broiler.batch` | `/broiler/batches/<encoded name>` |
| `pig.batch` | `/pig/batches/<group id>` |
| `pig.breeder` | `/pig/sows/<id>` |
| `layer.batch` | `/layer/batches/<id>` |
| `layer.housing` | `/layer/housings/<id>` |
| `equipment.item` | `/fleet/<id>` |
| `poultry.daily` | `/broiler/dailys/<id>` |
| `layer.daily` | `/layer/dailys/<id>` |
| `egg.daily` | `/layer/eggs/<id>` |
| `pig.daily` | `/pig/dailys/<id>` |
| `cattle.daily` | `/cattle/dailys/<id>` |
| `sheep.daily` | `/sheep/dailys/<id>` |
| `weighin.session` | `/weigh-in-sessions/<id>` |
| `cattle.forecast` | `/cattle/forecast` |
| `cattle.breeding` | `/cattle/breeding` |
| `cattle.log` | `/cattle/log` |

No operational record workspace should reintroduce legacy `ActivityPanel` or
`ActivityModal`. Comments are discussion; Activity is audit/history.

## Backend And Data State

### Stack

- React 18 / Vite SPA.
- Supabase JS client from `src/lib/supabase.js` only.
- React Router DOM.
- `idb` for IndexedDB/offline queue.
- Leaflet for Pasture Map rendering; Leaflet-Geoman powers draw/edit/snap
  controls.
- Vitest for unit/static tests.
- Playwright for e2e.
- ESLint + Prettier.
- Netlify production deploy from `main`.
- Netlify Functions (serverless): the Home Weather data proxy
  (`netlify/functions/weather-forecast.js`).

### Supabase Migrations

Current PROD architecture includes all applied migrations through `116`, plus
`125` through `153`. Recent load-bearing migrations:

- `100` processing batch lifecycle RPCs.
- `101`-`104` audited delete RPCs and hardening.
- `105` recurring task template creation RPC.
- `106` delete layer batch RPC.
- `107` delete fuel bill RPC.
- `108` delete feed input RPC.
- `109` drop dead daily-photo anon insert policy.
- `110` cattle calf-row heifer promotion.
- `111` weigh-in note -> canonical comment mirror.
- `112` cattle log sidecar tables/RPCs/triggers.
- `113` Light daily report 3-day own-record edit/delete window.
- `114` task photo 5-total DB backstop.
- `115` Task Center To Do List schema/RPCs/photos/mentions/digest fields.
- `116` Pasture Map CP1:
  - `pasture_import_batches`, self-referencing `land_areas`, and append-only
    `land_area_geometry_versions`.
  - PostGIS in `extensions` schema; geometry stored as 4326; acreage via
    `ST_Area(geom::geography)`.
  - Deny-all RLS; access only through SECURITY DEFINER RPCs.
  - `list_land_areas` read gate originally: `farm_team`, `management`, `admin`;
    migration `136` widens only this read RPC and `list_pasture_moves` to Light.
  - Import/classify/close/delete gates: `management`, `admin`.
  - OnX UUID becomes `source_external_id`; re-import updates, not duplicates.
  - Polygons import as `unclassified`/`pending_review`; LineStrings import as
    `outline_candidate`; no auto-close; invalid polygons are flagged, not fixed.
  - No fabricated last-grazed date; `baseline_no_history` is distinct.
- `125` Production legacy events:
  - `production_legacy_events` table with deny-all RLS.
  - `list_production_legacy_events(date,date)` SECURITY DEFINER read RPC.
  - Read gate: `farm_team`, `management`, `admin`; Light excluded.
  - Spreadsheet importer upserts by stable `source_key`; 69 rows imported to
    PROD on 2026-06-15.
- `126` Breeding-pig Activity entity:
  - Adds `pig.breeder` to `_activity_can_read` / `_activity_can_write`.
  - Existence check is `app_store` key `ppp-breeders-v1`, object id match.
  - Program access gate is `pig`.
- `127` Pasture Map CP2 draw/edit:
  - Adds `create_land_area(text,text,jsonb,text,text)` and
    `update_land_area_geometry(text,jsonb)` SECURITY DEFINER RPCs.
  - Management/admin only; EXECUTE granted to `authenticated` and revoked from
    `PUBLIC`/`anon`.
  - Reuses `_land_area_add_version`; edits append a new geometry version and
    stamp version source as `drawn`, while preserving the original area source
    in raw payload.
  - Validates polygon/multipolygon GeoJSON and rejects invalid/self-
    intersecting geometry; acreage remains geodesic.
  - PROD-applied on 2026-06-16 with schema reload and structural/PostgREST anon
    permission smokes. No PROD land-area rows were created.
- `128` Pasture Map CP3 move ledger / occupancy / rest:
  - Adds `pasture_move_events`, `pasture_move_impacts`,
    `_land_area_current_geom`, `_pasture_move_summary`, updated
    `_land_area_summary`, `list_pasture_moves`, and `record_pasture_move`.
  - Move impacts track destination/departure/overlap. Grazing state and current
    occupants are derived from dated move events.
- `129` Pasture Map CP4 planning/reports:
  - Adds `pasture_planned_moves`, planned-move create/list/status RPCs, and
    history/rest/stocking report RPCs.
- `130` Pasture Map CP6 field GPS tracks:
  - Adds `create_land_area_track` for farm-team/management/admin field-created
    outline candidates from GPS LineStrings.
- `131` Pasture Map CP7 line style:
  - Adds line color/weight support and manager/admin style update RPCs.
- `132` Pasture Map line patterns/defaults:
  - Adds `line_pattern`, solid/dashed/dotted validation, default imported OnX
    line styling, default field-track styling, and
    `update_land_area_line_style`.
  - Verified TEST and PROD artifacts present on 2026-06-17 by catalog checks.
- `133` task system generation support and To Do approval notifications:
  - Widens `notifications_type_check` for `todo_completion_submitted`.
  - Reissues `submit_todo_completion` so non-manager completion submissions
    notify management/admin while approval and auto-approval still notify the
    To Do creator.
  - TEST-applied on 2026-06-17; PROD-applied on 2026-06-18.
- `134` originator task/to-do edit photos:
  - Preserves RPC-only writes, append-only private photo storage, and the shared
    5-photo total cap.
  - PROD-applied on 2026-06-18.
- `135` Pasture Map temp-paddock lifecycle:
  - Adds narrow SECURITY DEFINER RPCs for real temp paddock create/rename/redraw,
    archive/restore, and admin hard-delete using `kind='paddock'` plus
    `permanence='temporary'`; existing permanent-area create/update/delete RPCs
    remain management/admin locked.
  - TEST- and PROD-applied/verified. Production temp-paddock lifecycle calls are
    supported.
- `136` Pasture Map Light read-only Map access:
  - CREATE OR REPLACEs only `list_land_areas(boolean)` and
    `list_pasture_moves(int)` to add `light` to those read gates.
  - Does not widen write, planning, rest, stocking, or history report RPCs.
  - TEST-applied by CC and PROD-applied by Codex on 2026-06-20 with
    `psql --single-transaction`; PostgREST schema reload was notified.
  - PROD verification confirmed the two read RPCs contain the Light gate and
    `record_pasture_move`, planned-move, rest, stocking, and history RPCs do not
    contain Light.
- `137` Pasture feeder-pig paddock destinations:
  - Adds the feeder-pig paddock destination support used by the current
    Pasture Map production code.
  - PROD-applied before the 2026-06-24 wrap.
- `138` Tier-1 RLS anon write-boundary hardening:
  - Drops legacy anon/public write policies on targeted daily/weigh-in/comment
    write tables while preserving authenticated `*_auth_all` policies.
  - PROD-applied and verified: zero targeted `*_anon_*` policies remain; five
    authenticated policies remain.
- `139`-`141` Pasture Map V1 reset:
  - `139_pasture_map_light_farm_team.sql` widens pasture-only Light permissions
    to the farm-team-level pasture RPC set. It does not widen Light outside
    Pasture Map.
  - `140_pasture_map_rotations.sql` adds server-backed manual rotation paths.
  - `141_pasture_map_measurements.sql` adds saved distance-measurement layers.
  - PROD-applied and verified on 2026-06-24.
- `142` System task title entity labels:
  - Adds optional `p_entity_label` to `generate_system_task_instance`, backfills
    open system task titles, and supports the corresponding `tasks-cron` deploy.
  - PROD-applied and verified on 2026-06-24; `tasks-cron` was deployed after the
    migration.
- `143` Pasture Map reset-area-grazing-history:
  - `delete_land_area_grazing_history(p_id text)` SECDEF, management/admin gated.
    Clears one area's `pasture_move_impacts` and detaches it from every
    `pasture_move_events` from/to, then resets `baseline_no_history` so state
    re-derives to "no move history". Other areas' impacts are preserved.
  - PROD-applied + verified 2026-06-25. The UI button and client wrapper that
    called it are removed; the RPC stays deployed but unused. Append-only ledger
    background lives in the Pasture Map Load-Bearing Contract below.
- `144` Newsletter Engine data/RPC boundary:
  - Adds tables: `newsletter_issues`, `newsletter_fact_candidates`,
    `newsletter_photos`, `newsletter_runs`, and `newsletter_settings`.
  - Deny-all RLS; admin-only SECDEF RPCs for issue/intake/fact/photo/settings
    management; exactly three anon read RPCs for published list, published issue,
    and token-gated preview.
  - Public payloads use structured JSON blocks and approved photo paths only;
    no raw AI HTML and no `source_private_path` exposure.
  - Preview tokens are enabled/expiring, rotate on publish/unpublish/regenerate,
    and publish disables pre-publication preview links. Anon `noindex` is
    literal/locked true. Month inputs validate strict calendar `YYYY-MM`.
  - PROD catalog verified 2026-06-26: all five tables exist with RLS enabled;
    anon EXECUTE is present only on `list_published_newsletters`,
    `get_published_newsletter`, and `get_newsletter_preview` among the sampled
    newsletter RPCs.
- `145` Newsletter storage buckets:
  - Private `newsletter-staging` bucket: admin-only read/write for uploads and
    copied planner photos before public consent.
  - Public `newsletter-public` bucket: public read, admin-only write, populated
    only after admin photo approval; unapprove deletes the public copy.
  - PROD catalog verified 2026-06-26: `newsletter-staging` exists with
    `public=false`; `newsletter-public` exists with `public=true`.
- `146` Newsletter automation:
  - Adds the earlier Checkpoint B automation layer for
    `newsletter-harvest`, monthly reminder/task support, AI/template draft
    persistence, run logging, and a gated cron-invocation RPC.
  - PROD-applied + verified on 2026-06-29 as Gate 1 for PR #44, immediately
    before migration `151`. The monthly cron schedule remains intentionally off.
- `147` Pasture Map grazing entry delete and parent overlap:
  - Adds `delete_pasture_move(p_move_id)` SECDEF, management/admin gated,
    authenticated EXECUTE only, anon denied.
  - Per-stay delete removes the selected move and cascades its impacts. If the
    deleted move has a later move for the same animal group, the RPC clears only
    that later move's linked departure impacts for the touched areas and
    preserves the later move event. This prevents completed-stay drift.
  - `_land_area_summary` suppresses child-derived overlap state for direct
    parent pastures, so child paddock occupancy/rest does not color the parent
    fill. Parent-only history now resolves to baseline instead of visible
    no-history fill when appropriate.
  - TEST behavior and PROD catalog were verified on 2026-06-26.
- `148` Pasture Map group records, actual-weight metrics, planned cleanup:
  - Adds `pasture_move_events.total_weight_lbs` with a positive-value check and
    updates move/report RPCs to expose actual move-time group weight.
  - Updates `record_pasture_move` to accept optional `p_total_weight_lbs`;
    pasture group history/stay metrics use only recorded data for lbs/ac.
  - Drops the unused `pasture_planned_moves` table and planned-move RPCs. The
    rotation editor is now the planning source, and the group record move box
    records current area to next rotation area.
  - PROD smoke verified on 2026-06-26: weight column exists, record-move weight
    signature exists, and `pasture_planned_moves` is absent.
- `149` Pasture Map rest/history reconciliation:
  - Replaces `_land_area_summary` so orphan `pasture_move_impacts` whose move
    event has NULL `to_land_area_id`/`from_land_area_id` no longer derive
    occupancy, last touch, or resting state. This resolves the FP3/FP3A1 defect
    where the Map showed "Resting/Last grazed" while Reports showed no visible
    direct stay.
  - Preserves migration `147` child-from-parent suppression and does not change
    schema, RLS, grants, or return shape. Stale orphan impact rows are ignored,
    not deleted.
  - PROD-applied + verified 2026-06-27: FP3 and FP3A1 returned to baseline;
    Pig Pasture #4 remained occupied as positive control.
- `150` Pasture Map open-line edit:
  - Adds `update_land_area_track(p_id text, p_line_geojson jsonb)` SECDEF,
    management/admin gated, authenticated/service/postgres EXECUTE only and no
    anon/PUBLIC grant.
  - Validates LineString/MultiLineString with at least two points, allows only
    existing `outline_candidate` targets, rewrites `land_areas.raw_geometry` in
    place, and intentionally writes no acreage, geometry version, promotion, or
    schema/RLS/grant/return-shape change.
  - PROD-applied + verified 2026-06-27. PostgREST schema reload was issued
    manually after apply because this is a new exposed RPC. PR #45 later added
    `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'` to the migration file for future/fresh-env
    applies only; the migration was not re-applied to PROD because the function
    body was already live/verified.
- `151` Newsletter Autopilot:
  - Extends newsletter settings/issues for tone, length/detail, source
    coverage, photo plan, photo targets/minimums, and past-issue context;
    updates settings/generation input/admin/service RPCs; preserves mig `144`'s
    exactly-three anon RPC surface.
  - PROD-applied + verified on 2026-06-29 immediately after `146`. Verification
    covered the `146` RPC surface, the `151` RPC/settings/photo-plan additions,
    and the single backward-compatible `update_newsletter_settings` overload.
    `newsletter-harvest` was redeployed after the SQL gate (v2 at this
    mig-151/PR #44 checkpoint — see Current State for the current active version);
    the PROD-only `NEWSLETTER_AI_API_KEY` secret is live, so AI calls can use
    Anthropic in production. TEST intentionally remains without that key.
- `152` Pasture Map manager hard delete:
  - Widens `hard_delete_land_area` from admin-only to management+admin, keeping
    the occupancy guard, child-detach, and no-purge soft-delete path unchanged;
    the client danger zone + Area-record gate moved to `isManager`.
  - Applied to TEST and PROD on 2026-06-30 with the role gate, grants, occupancy
    guard, and no-purge path verified on PROD.
- `153` Newsletter archive-link gating:
  - Adds `archive_access_token` + `archive_access_expires_at` to
    `newsletter_settings`; key-gates the two published-archive anon RPCs
    (`list_published_newsletters`, `get_published_newsletter` gain `p_key` and
    return NULL unless the key matches + is unexpired, constant-time compare via
    `_newsletter_archive_key_ok`); `publish_newsletter_issue` mints a fresh 7-day
    key; adds the admin-only `regenerate_newsletter_archive_link`; and surfaces
    the key + expiry through `get_newsletter_settings`. Anon surface stays the
    same three RPCs (`get_newsletter_preview` unchanged). No BEGIN/COMMIT in the
    file (exec_sql / `psql --single-transaction` wrap it).
  - TEST-applied + behaviorally verified via `scripts/apply_test_mig_153.cjs`
    (locked w/ no/wrong/expired key; valid key works; admin-only regenerate kills
    the old key). PROD-applied + verified 2026-06-30 via
    `psql --single-transaction -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1` with a behavioral check;
    PostgREST reloaded via the file's `NOTIFY pgrst`. No Edge Function or Netlify
    env change. Reverses the prior "public no-login archive" contract.

Special migration notes:

- `082` is intentionally unused.
- `083` public webform submitter identity is shelved.
- `085` was applied before `084` in PROD so duplicate active daily identities
  were cleaned up before unique indexes.
- Migration number `061` (an early daily-report soft-delete/restore step) is a
  skipped/superseded number; `067_daily_soft_delete.sql` is the live daily
  soft-delete migration. No `061` file exists in the repo tree/history; if a PROD
  ledger entry for `061` ever matters, confirm it read-only before relying on it.
- New or changed SECDEF RPC return shapes need `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`.
- PROD `exec_sql` is forbidden. Preferred PROD SQL apply remains `psql` with
  `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` per [HO.md](HO.md). The 2026-06-24 `139`-`142` release used
  Supabase's linked `db query` path with an explicit `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` wrapper
  because no raw `PROD_DB_URL` was present in the shell.

### Storage Buckets And Media

Known document/photo surfaces are locked by static guards:

- `daily-photos`.
- `task-photos`.
- `task-request-photos`.
- `comment-photos`.
- `equipment-maintenance-docs`.
- `fuel-bills`.
- `cattle-feed-pdfs`.
- `batch-documents`.

Newsletter buckets are current PROD infrastructure as of 2026-06-26:
`newsletter-staging` is private/admin-only for uploads and copied planner photos
before approval; `newsletter-public` is public-read/admin-write and receives
only approved newsletter photo bytes.

Append-only upload expectations:

- Uploads use `upsert: false` unless a lane explicitly changes the contract.
- Duplicate-object errors are treated as retry success where the upload path is
  idempotent.
- Private buckets use signed URLs; public buckets use public URLs.
- No code should mutate `storage.objects` directly.

### Route Ownership

- `src/lib/routes.js` owns canonical paths and legacy aliases.
- `src/lib/activityRegistry.js` owns entity-to-record routes for Activity and
  notifications.
- `main.jsx` adapts URLs into view state. Do not add separate alias maps in
  views.

### Authentication And Roles

- Ronnie remains final gate owner.
- App roles include `admin`, `management`, `farm_team`, `equipment_tech`,
  `light`, and `inactive`.
- Runtime permission decisions must be enforced by RLS/RPCs, not just hidden UI.
- Report/form submission is login-required. The session user is the submitter;
  `owner_profile_id` is stamped server-side and client-supplied profile IDs are
  not trusted.
- Light allowlist excludes `/production`, `/weighins`, program dashboards,
  `/fleet`, `/activity`, `/admin`, and client-error review. `/pasture-map` is
  allowed for Light with pasture farm-team-level Map/Field working controls;
  runtime permission is enforced by RPC/RLS, not only by the client allowlist.

## Design System

### Typography

- Canonical font family: self-hosted `Hanken Grotesk`.
- Canonical font-size set: `10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 26`.
- Allowed display sizes: `32, 34, 36, 48, 56`.
- Canonical shared-component font-weight scale: `400, 500, 600, 700`.

### Color Hierarchy

- Ordinary main text uses pure black (`#000000`): primary section/card/row
  titles, labels, buttons, and primary animal or production numbers.
- Supporting text uses muted gray: helper copy, subtext, metadata, secondary
  labels, and non-primary category labels.
- Intentional accent/semantic text remains allowed where color carries meaning:
  warning/error/success/info states, weather rain/freeze cues, overdue labels,
  and text inside approved semantic pastel blocks.
- A text-color cleanup must be typography-only unless the build explicitly says
  it is redesigning the affected block's background.
- CP0 section A12 program-accent discipline: the locked program palette (pig `#2B4C9B`,
  broiler `#C7920A`, layer `#D2601A`, cattle `#8E3328`, sheep `#4CA035`,
  equip/admin `#6B7280`) may appear ONLY on (a) the selected nav/tab pill, (b) a
  small dot in mixed lists, (c) optionally one headline figure, and (d) the
  primary/brand button via per-program `--brand` re-tint. (d) is a ratified
  extension of A12.1's permitted-uses list, decided 2026-06-17. Program color is
  never general body text, stat numbers, card backgrounds, left-border accents,
  or a status-color override. Species/group/herd/breed names render as dot +
  black label, not colored text. The dark-green top-bar chrome stays green.

### Spacing And Controls

- Standard button pad is `10px 16px`.
- Standard button vertical pad is `10px`.
- Inputs/selects/textareas use radius `10` (`--radius-sm`, CP0 section A3), border
  `1px var(--border-strong)`, pad `8px 11px`, and brand focus treatment.

### Radius

- CP0 section A3: 10px is the floor for real UI controls. Canonical radius tokens are
  `10`, `12`, `14`, `999` (pill), and `'50%'` (circle); `0` is allowed for
  intentionally square edges. The values `4`-`9` are retired on real UI.
- Genuinely decorative sub-components (legend swatches, accent/LED bars, progress
  bars, dividers, inline-code chips, small color dots) keep a sub-10 radius ONLY
  on a line tagged with the `radius-allow` marker; the floor guard fails any
  untagged sub-10 radius.
- Scope exemptions: the `.home` island (`homeRedesign.css`) keeps `9/12/18`; the
  public `#webform-container` island radius is pending the CP5 forms pass (see
  Build Queue item 3).
- New sub-10px control/card/row radii require a Ronnie-approved amendment and a
  matching guard update.
- Guards: `radius_floor_static.test.js` (floor + allowlist) and
  `design_token_contract_static.test.js` (canonical set on locked primitives).

### Stacking And Elevation

- Dialog layer order keeps Confirm/Delete at toast `9000`; other overlays and
  modals remain below that tier in the shared z-index ladder.
- Header stacking contract: the sticky header bar establishes a stacking
  context, so its hamburger and notifications dropdowns portal to
  `document.body` at z-index `9000` (above page content such as the Pasture map
  chrome, below the blocking-modal tier). Do not rely on raising the bar's own
  z-index — that would regress the `500`-tier page modals.

### Save Model

- Explicit Save/Submit by surface class is mandatory for submit-style flows.
- Autosave is mandatory for edit-in-place flows.

### Canonical Components

- Use canonical role owners before introducing equivalent alternatives.
- Canonical owners include `RecordPageShell`, `RecordSequenceNav`,
  `recordPageControls`, `DeleteModal`, `ConfirmModal`, `InlineNotice`, and
  record collaboration primitives.
- Canonical list/data owners include `DataTable`, `Badge`, `StatusText`,
  `EmptyState`, `OperationalListEmptyState`, `SectionBand`, `Toolbar`, `Tabs`,
  and `programColors`.
- `DataTable` is the default owner for row-comparable list surfaces. It owns the
  real table, mobile stacked row, load/error/empty, Active/Complete band, and
  keyboard row-open behavior.

---

## Load-Bearing Contracts

### Cross-App Rules

- Do not bypass RLS with client-side assumptions.
- Do not add browser secrets beyond approved `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`,
  `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and approved dev/test flags.
- Do not create new Supabase clients outside `src/lib/supabase.js`.
- Do not use raw browser `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt` in product surfaces.
- Do not add route aliases outside `src/lib/routes.js`.
- Do not edit docs during normal build/hotfix lanes unless Ronnie explicitly
  asks for docs or wrap work.

### Cold-Boot And Fail-Closed Loading

Data surfaces must fail closed on load errors:

- Record pages render in this order: loading -> loadError -> not-found -> record.
- List/hub surfaces expose `data-<surface>-loaded` markers and gate rows/empty
  states behind `!loadError`.
- Load failures clear stale rows/state, show `InlineNotice`, and should provide a
  user-gated Retry.
- Sidecar reads may degrade best-effort only when the primary record/list load
  is valid.
- Header badge counts soft-fail; Header panel content fails closed.

### Activity, Comments, Mentions, Notifications

- Activity is audit/system history. Comments are user discussion.
- Runtime Activity access goes through SECDEF RPCs: `list_activity_events`,
  `list_global_activity`, `record_activity_event`, and domain-specific SECDEF
  RPCs that insert `activity_events`.
- No direct client `.from('activity_events')`, `.from('activity_mentions')`,
  `.from('comments')`, or `.from('comment_edits')`.
- Legacy Activity composer/count RPCs remain retired; do not use them.
- `RecordActivityLog` filters `comment.posted` and shows audit only.
- `CommentsSection` owns discussion, attachments, edit history, soft delete, and
  mentions.
- Mention bodies stay human-readable `@Name`; UUIDs do not appear in body text.
- Mention notifications route to the operational record page and target comment.
- Valid notification types: `task_completed`, `mention`, `comment_mention`,
  `todo_completion_approved`, `todo_completion_rejected`, `todo_converted`, and
  `todo_completion_submitted`.
- Notification writes happen inside SECDEF paths; client code must not insert or
  delete notifications.

### Activity Entity Additions

A new Activity entity requires all of this:

- SQL `_activity_can_read` branch.
- `activityRegistry` entry.
- Route/deep-link mapping.
- Permission and existence semantics.
- Record or workflow surface.
- Static test coverage.
- Activity/event logging strategy.

Workflow/worktable entities:

- `cattle.forecast` uses entity_id `cattle-forecast`; Forecast month bucket logs
  filter by `payload.month_key`.
- `cattle.breeding` uses entity_id `cattle-breeding`.
- These are table/workflow audit streams and are program-gated rather than
  row-existence gated.

### Entity Mutations And Audit Atomicity

- `runMutation` is for routine client-side mutations with best-effort Activity.
- `runMutation` must not know table names or business rules.
- `runMutation` is not transactional.
- Audit-critical delete/restore/transfer/status flows should move to SECDEF RPCs
  that mutate data and insert Activity in one transaction.
- Mutation inventory counts live in
  `mutation_semantics_inventory_static.test.js`.

### Delete, Restore, And Recovery

- Hard-delete owner inventory lives in `hard_delete_owner_static.test.js`.
- Soft-delete protected roots must not have direct client deletes: cattle,
  sheep, `cattle_dailys`, `sheep_dailys`, `poultry_dailys`, `layer_dailys`,
  `egg_dailys`, `pig_dailys`.
- Daily reports soft-delete through `soft_delete_daily_report` and restore
  through `restore_daily_report`.
- Cattle/sheep animals soft-delete/restore through their animal RPCs.
- Calving sub-row delete goes through `delete_cattle_calving_record`.

### Production

- Production means processed animals and eggs, not current inventory.
- There is no combined production total. Home and `/production` display per-
  program totals only.
- `/production` is a production reporting surface, not an import reconciliation
  workspace. Visible page language should be totals/events by program and year;
  do not expose Planner-vs-backfill/source-split/audit framing in the primary
  page.
- Production sources:
  - Broilers from `app_store.ppp-v4` processed/auto-processed batches.
  - Pigs from `app_store.ppp-feeders-v1.processingTrips`.
  - Cattle from `cattle_processing_batches.actual_process_date`.
  - Sheep from `sheep_processing_batches.actual_process_date`.
  - Eggs from `egg_dailys` counts, displayed as dozens.
  - Legacy backfill from `production_legacy_events`.
- Internal reconciliation: Planner wins by program/year coverage. If Planner has
  events for a program/year, Planner is the counted total and every legacy row
  for that same program/year is held out internally, including rows that
  represent the same batch dated differently. If Planner has no events for a
  program/year, legacy rows count as historical backfill.
- `/production` must not display Podio terminology, Raw-Podio columns, or
  delta-vs-Podio columns. It also must not display a visible Reconciliation tab,
  Legacy/Audit Review panel, source split, Held out, or Conflict columns.
- YoY is per program/year, not across programs.
- Summary is an all-years Program x Year matrix. Production Events show actual
  processing events only: no egg-day rows, no year picker, and imported legacy
  rows remain visible even when held out of Summary totals by the Planner-wins
  coverage rule.
- Processing events should link to record pages when a matching planner record
  can be confidently resolved, including broiler batch links by date/count.
- Light users are excluded by route allowlist and RPC role gate.

### Processing Calendar

- Processing Calendar is distinct from the existing `/production` reporting
  page. Build Queue item 2 (`Processing Calendar Asana import and native
  workflow`) is the only home for its build scope; do not duplicate or fork that
  plan elsewhere in this file.
- `/production` remains the processed-output reporting surface. The Processing
  Calendar should be a workflow/schedule/record surface for processing batches,
  milestones, comments, attachments, custom fields, and subtasks.
- Processing Calendar status vocabulary is exactly `Planned`, `In Process`,
  and `Complete`. Use `src/lib/processingStatusDisplay.js` for display mapping:
  `planned`/`scheduled` -> `Planned`, `active` -> `In Process`, and
  `processed`/`complete` -> `Complete`. Do not migrate stored program values
  just to change labels. Pig batch displays must use the pig-specific helper
  because raw `active` can mean either a future zero-head placeholder
  (`Planned`) or pigs already in the feeder workflow (`In Process`).
- The Asana token is a live secret and must not be committed, pasted into docs,
  or stored in source. Importer implementations must use Supabase Vault or an
  equivalent approved secret path.
- Existing CP0/design-system contracts apply. Do not copy prototype styles that
  conflict with true-black text, radius floor, closed badge set, table hover,
  row-lift openable affordance, or program-accent rules unless Ronnie approves
  a Constitution amendment.

### Monthly Newsletter

- Current shipped scope is Newsletter Autopilot + the direction-first redesign +
  archive-link gating: link-gated public archive + admin editor, migrations
  `144`/`145` (data/storage/public boundary), `146` (automation/run logging/cron
  RPC support), `151` (Autopilot settings/source coverage/photo plan/past-issue
  context), `153` (archive-link gating), and the `newsletter-harvest` Edge
  Function (PROD v5 / TEST v1). Autopilot gathers planner facts first, lets Ronnie
  steer facts/Q&A/tone/length, writes or revises with AI/template composer,
  generates a photo plan, supports private upload + approval + place planned
  photos, previews, and publishes. The real AI path is enabled in PROD through the
  PROD-only `NEWSLETTER_AI_API_KEY` Edge Function secret; TEST is intentionally
  not configured with that key.
- UI: the admin (`/admin/newsletter`) and public (`/newsletter`) surfaces follow
  the direction-first redesign (PR #54), built on the app's design tokens +
  shared primitives. Admin = a "this month" spotlight + section-banded openable
  tiles (list), a 7-step tracker (Facts · Steer · Draft · Revise · Photos ·
  Review · Publish) over step cards + a 312px utility rail (editor), and a grouped
  in-view Settings sub-surface (no route alias). Public = an editorial masthead,
  hover-lift archive cards, an issue page with numbers strip + reading time +
  sign-off + "More issues". The draft stays AI-owned (read-only blocks, revise-in-
  place, guarded rewrite).
- ACCESS (migration `153`, PR #59): the public archive is LINK-GATED, not open.
  `/newsletter`, `/newsletter/latest`, and issue slugs require a current,
  unexpired `?key=` (one shared archive access token in `newsletter_settings`
  that unlocks the new issue + all past issues). Publish mints a fresh 7-day key;
  the admin "Public link" card (Copy/Regenerate) rotates it on demand (instant
  revoke when someone leaves). A missing/invalid/expired key shows a "link
  expired" lock screen. The goal is that former staff can never keep a working
  link. Admins always read every issue via the authed admin RPCs regardless of
  the public key state. The draft preview (`?preview=<token>`) is a SEPARATE path
  with its own 30-day token and is unchanged by `153`.
- Public issue pages must be `noindex`; this is an invariant, not a setting admins
  can accidentally drift.
- Admin creation/editing lives inside the planner and is admin-only. The public
  reader surface is web-only; no PDF, email send, RSS, or reader login is part
  of the current requirement.
- The newsletter voice is factual positive PR for owners and periphery staff,
  styled like White Creek Farm's current emails. Titles follow the pattern
  `White Creek Farm June Review`; target length is about two pages.
- Content should be based on prior-month facts: animals on farm, births, notable
  processing/production/yield records, and other genuinely noteworthy good-news
  events. Do not include finances or mortalities. First names of team members
  are OK; avoid sensitive/private details and never expose private file paths.
- Fact accuracy mirrors the app's canonical logic (PR #50/#55). Broilers "brought
  to processing" counts `totalToProcessor` (NOT the unpopulated processed-count
  fields), windows on the brought date (`processingDate − 1`, since a batch goes
  to the processor the day before its processing date), and falls back to
  projected live birds (`birdCountActual − mortalityCumulative`) for a batch
  brought-but-not-yet-tallied (self-corrects once `totalToProcessor` is entered).
- Year-over-year production: the harvest appends a deterministic
  "Production — year over year" stats section (exact, never AI-authored) to every
  draft — full-year vs prior-full-year for all five Production-tab programs
  (cattle/broilers/pigs/sheep/eggs), mirroring the tab's per-program quantity
  rules + Planner-wins-by-coverage (legacy backfills only program-years with no
  Planner data); eggs shown in dozens. Logic lives in the parity-locked
  `newsletterProductionYoy.js` (src/lib + `_shared` mirror); a strip-then-reappend
  keeps it from duplicating on revise.
- The monthly workflow is minimum-human-input but Ronnie-directed:
  gather this month's facts from planner sources without AI, let Ronnie select/
  add facts and answer Monthly Q&A, then AI writes a draft and photo shot-list.
  Revisions should edit the current draft in place. Photo requests should be
  generated from what is noteworthy; admins can add/remove suggestions and must
  approve photos before publication. Every issue should have at least a few
  photos.
- AI generation must stay inside the planner via a fixed prompt/template in the
  API/Edge Function setup. The model returns structured blocks only; the
  renderer whitelists block types and never renders raw AI HTML. Ronnie remains
  the final editorial approver.
- Data boundary: newsletter tables are deny-all RLS and exposed only through
  narrow SECURITY DEFINER RPCs. The anon surface is exactly three RPCs — published
  list, published issue, and token-gated preview. As of migration `153` the
  published list + published issue are additionally ARCHIVE-KEY-GATED (they take
  `p_key` and return NULL unless it matches the current, unexpired
  `archive_access_token`, constant-time compare via `_newsletter_archive_key_ok`);
  the preview RPC keeps its own draft token. Public and preview payloads expose
  approved photo paths only; draft facts, intake, runs, settings, and private
  source paths stay admin-only. The harvest detectors + draft composer run
  server-side inside `newsletter-harvest` (so detector/composer changes require an
  Edge Function redeploy).
- Photo boundary: uploads/copies start in private `newsletter-staging`. Approval
  copies bytes to public `newsletter-public`; unapproval deletes the public copy.
  A photo row being present or suggested is not public consent.
- Preview boundary: preview links require `preview_enabled=true`, a matching
  token, and an unexpired `preview_expires_at`. Publish rotates/disables preview
  links so a pre-publication URL cannot expose later draft edits.

### Pasture Map

- Pasture Map architecture is provider-neutral: GeoJSON/PostGIS owns geometry;
  Leaflet renders the client map; OnX KML and drawn polygons are input sources;
  Google is not the geometry source.
- `land_areas` is the single self-referencing land model. It can represent
  pasture > paddock and feeder-pig area > section > paddock.
- Geometry history is append-only in `land_area_geometry_versions`; editing a
  boundary writes a new version instead of mutating history.
- Species is decoupled from land. `designation` is only a hint; animal-group
  occupancy belongs to dated move events in `pasture_move_events`.
- Imported/drawn land starts `baseline_no_history=true`; no fake last-grazed
  date is seeded.
- LineStrings are outline candidates and require human close/validation. Never
  auto-close an OnX LineString. In the UI these are called Tracks / Lines and
  are draft geometry only: no acreage, no move destination, no direct permanent
  promotion. Management/admin can reshape an existing saved Track/Line in place
  through `update_land_area_track`; this is line-only, outline-candidate-only,
  and does not write acreage, promotion, or geometry-version history.
- Computed acreage is geodesic and the UI shows it read-only. OnX/raw/manual
  acreage can exist as cross-check data, but the normal editing path must not
  ask users to type acreage or rest days.
- Draw/edit controls use Leaflet-Geoman. Snapping, live area/perimeter measure,
  Escape exit, and client self-intersection warnings are UI requirements; the
  migration `127` RPC validity gates are the database backstop. Measure is
  transient and must never persist a land area/track/temp paddock.
- Planner groups are derived, not user-entered. Canonical move/planning keys are:
  cattle herds -> `animal_type='cattle_herd'`, `group_key=herd`; sheep flocks ->
  `animal_type='sheep_flock'`, `group_key=flock`; breeder pigs ->
  `animal_type='breeder_pigs'`, `group_key='sow-1'|'sow-2'|'sow-3'|'boars'`;
  feeder pigs -> `animal_type='feeder_pigs'`, `group_key=sub.id`.
- Access: `farm_team`, `management`, `admin` can read/view/measure and use the
  Map working controls. Management/admin own permanent area import/classify/
  close/draw/edit, Tracks / Lines cleanup, promotion, and permanent-area
  lifecycle actions. Farm-team can record moves through the group record move
  box and create/edit/archive their own temp paddocks/tracks through migration
  `135`.
  `equipment_tech` and inactive users are excluded. Light is pasture farm-team-
  level through migration `139`: Light keeps the farm-team Map/Field working
  controls and is NOT read-only/Map-only; only management/admin-only actions stay
  gated, and write/report RPCs reject roles outside the granted set.
- Current Pasture Map tabs are Map / Field / Reports. Plan is folded into Map;
  Setup was already removed. Map is the single working surface: hover/tap reads
  a name + type/acres-only bubble (no rest/grazing state, occupant, or
  last-moved line); clicking a map area opens the accessible Area MODAL
  (`PastureAreaModal.jsx`:
  role=dialog, aria-modal, focus trap, backdrop) which hosts the same canonical
  Area Record body used by Reports: area summary, explicit name editor, Grazing
  History, and role-gated management/config controls (classification, parent
  pasture, line style, redraw, archive/restore, admin hard-delete). There is NO
  move form in the modal. The modal has one close affordance, the upper-right
  `X`, and it debounces/saves review edits on close. Area name editing is
  explicit Edit -> Save/Cancel with Enter-to-save and Escape-to-cancel; do not
  reintroduce blur-save naming.
  The slim side panel holds Animal Groups pop-out openable tiles, not flat
  tables. A group tile opens an inline group record beside the map, not a modal.
  The record order is group details, chip-based rotation editor, current->next
  move box with date/time and optional actual group weight, then grazing
  history. The rotation editor owns future planning; the old planned-move
  table/RPCs and free-form Record/Plan forms are removed. Tracks / Lines, the
  classification/review queue, and archived recovery are collapsed sections in
  Reports. Reviewed permanent paddocks require a parent pasture (UI-enforced via
  `update_land_area` `p_parent_id`; no DB constraint, no auto-backfill);
  parentless paddocks surface in a Reports "Needs pasture assignment" section.
  Field is phone-first execution/offline queue. The Field bottom toolbar is
  Walk paddock / Draw paddock / Measure only; one-time setup/help lives in a
  secondary "Offline setup" status-row affordance (offline NAIP imagery
  download + the self-contained field guide) and saved measurements in a
  secondary "Saved measurements" toggle; the rail base/overlay popover stays available
  in Field. The field guide is served from `public/pasture-map-field-guide.html`
  (self-contained, inline images); `public/sw.js` serves an exact runtime-cached
  navigation before the SPA shell fallback so the guide works offline after one
  online open; `ensurePersistentStorage()` requests persistent storage on mount.
  A temp paddock drawn from the rotation editor stays saveable while the inline
  group record is open. Reports use pop-out openable
  tiles for Areas and Animal Groups; opening an Area renders the same canonical
  Area Record body. Reports also include animal-group grazing stays/metrics,
  inactive groups behind an Include inactive groups filter, and per-stay delete.
  Track/Line records hide grazing history, state, acreage, and rested-day rows.
  Light is pasture farm-team-level on the merged Map and Field.
- Map chrome is one right-side icon rail: Fit Farm, My Location, base/overlay,
  and Legend. The base/overlay control is a popover containing Satellite/Topo base map selection plus
  Pastures/Paddocks/Temp/Lines overlay toggles. Legend is a separate popover,
  mutually exclusive with the base/overlay popover. Hybrid basemap and hybrid reference/transport
  overlay code are removed. Zoom is scroll-wheel/pinch only; Leaflet default
  zoom controls and custom rail +/- buttons are intentionally absent.
- Move ledger / coloring contract: an area's occupancy/rest state is
  read-derived in `_land_area_summary` from `pasture_move_impacts`
  (`destination`/`overlap`/`departure`), not stored on `land_areas`.
  `record_pasture_move` still writes overlap impacts for intersecting areas, but
  migration `147` suppresses direct-child overlap impacts when deriving parent
  pasture state. Migration `149` additionally ignores orphan impacts whose move
  event has lost its directional
  `to_land_area_id`/`from_land_area_id` link, so an area cannot read
  "Resting/Last grazed" without a visible stay or non-orphan impact explaining
  it. A permanent paddock's bright-green stroke is a LOCKED designation color,
  independent of state; the FILL is the state.
- Boundary visibility toggles hide/show pasture, paddock, temp-paddock, or
  Lines/Tracks strokes only. Animal occupancy fills and group markers remain
  visible. A group's occupied-area marker is a teardrop location pin in the
  group color with a "Name · count" label (no initials avatar); rotation stops
  are numbered dots, and the number at the group's current area is suppressed so
  it does not stack under the pin. Draft lines render on the working Map; Field
  has a Draft lines toggle; selected draft lines show for context.
- Permanent pasture stroke is locked blue 4px; permanent paddock stroke is
  locked bright green 4px. Temp paddocks default to white dashed 5px and can be
  restyled. Only temp paddocks and GPS/field tracks have editable line style.
- Open-line edit is built. Entry points are the Area modal and Reports
  Tracks/Lines list. It routes through `update_land_area_track`, preserves
  Tracks/Lines draft semantics, and must not be broadened to polygon boundary
  edit or promotion without a new scoped migration/guard.
- Current Pasture Map includes the real-roster redesign, move ledger,
  animal-color occupancy, pop-out openable launch tiles, inline group records,
  chip-based rotation planning, group-record move logging, actual-weight
  grazing metrics, per-stay grazing delete, history/rest/stocking reports,
  offline vector snapshot/queue, offline NAIP imagery cache, GPS field tracks,
  line styling/pattern controls, temp-paddock lifecycle, the single-X Area
  modal, the shared Map/Reports Area Record body, explicit area-name editor,
  open-line edit, and Light pasture farm-team-level Map/Field access. It does
  not include daily-report wiring or a generic undo stack; corrections are
  delete the grazing stay and re-record the move.
- Future Pasture Map lanes should preserve the shipped Map / Field / Reports IA,
  the click-to-open Area modal, the Reports accordion, and the provider-neutral
  geometry/RPC model unless a new Ronnie-approved decision explicitly reopens
  any of them.

### Daily Reports

- Daily reports have dedicated record pages for poultry, layer, egg, pig, cattle,
  and sheep.
- Daily report list surfaces and Home "Last 5 Days" use shared white
  `DailyRecordCards` / `.hoverable-tile` record cards, including the Home-tile
  lift, focus ring, and trailing chevron at every breakpoint.
- All six open directly editable; no edit-mode toggle.
- Daily duplicate prevention is DB-backed for poultry/pig/layer/cattle/sheep by
  partial unique indexes (`084`) after cleanup (`085`); egg duplicate prevention
  is warning/pre-submit only.
- Add Feed quick-log rows are not full daily reports.
- Missed-report checks exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Daily edits route through `updateDailyReport` / `update_daily_report`.
- Daily deletes route through `soft_delete_daily_report`.
- Light can edit/delete only own rows inside the server-side window.

### Cattle And Sheep

- Cattle and sheep use dedicated Supabase tables, not `app_store`.
- Active cattle herds: `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, `bulls`.
- Active sheep flocks: `rams`, `ewes`, `feeders`.
- Outcome states are `processed`, `deceased`, `sold`.
- Cattle Herds default to grouped herd sections when no filters/search/non-default
  sort are active. Any active filter/search/non-default sort renders one flat
  matched-results table through the shared `DataTable`. The `Sold` herd filter
  is flat and sold-only; it must not retain Processed/Deceased/Sold group
  headers. `Last Activity` sort/column reads the cattle animal Activity stream
  through `listActivityEvents`, shows date/time, defaults newest-first, and sorts
  missing activity last.
- Sheep Flocks render a single always-flat list (the grouped/flat view toggle was
  removed). A column/display picker chooses which of the full field set shows;
  `tag` is always shown; the choice persists in saved views (`columnVisible`
  gates `flatColumns`). Outcome flocks stay browsable in
  `SheepCollapsibleOutcomeSections` below the flat list. Do not reintroduce a
  sheep `viewMode` toggle.
- Heifer-to-cow promotion fires from both calving records and calf-row dam links.
- Manual transfer goes through `transfer_cattle_animal` /
  `transfer_sheep_animal`.
- Processing-batch unschedule/delete go through audited SECDEF RPCs
  `unschedule_cattle_processing_batch` / `delete_sheep_processing_batch`.
- Cattle animal records in outcome states show `Age at processing` / `Age at
  sale` / `Age at death` from the terminal event date (processing-batch date,
  sale date, or death date); active herds show current `Age`. Cattle
  processing-batch rows show each cow's age at the batch processing date.
- Cattle Log (`/cattle/log`) is a comment-backed program field journal on the
  singleton `cattle.log` entity. It supports keyword search, @mentions, photo
  attachments, offline create replay, issue filters, and #tag mirrors.

### Pig

- Pig feeder group started counts are authoritative.
- Current count is ledger-derived, not persisted `currentCount`.
- `pig.batch` record pages own metadata, sub-batches, mortality, planned trips,
  processing trips, forecast/current/FCR, send-to-trip source display, Comments,
  and Activity.
- Keep pig batch workflow split across `PigBatchPage`, `PigBatchHubTile`,
  `usePigMortality`, `usePigSubBatches`, `usePigPlannedTrips`, and
  `usePigProcessingTrips`.
- `PigContext.feedersLoaded` is the readiness boundary.
- Farm-born feeder batches are created from farrowing cycles, not manually from
  `/pig/batches`.
- Planned-trip row shape stays `{id, date, sex, subBatchId, plannedCount,
  order}`.
- Planned-trip locks live only in `ppp-pig-planned-trip-locks-v1`.
- Planned-trip forecast weights are render-only and based on DOB/farrowing age
  at trip date times Global ADG.
- Pig Batches hub rows use the locked 14-column inspection grid and open the
  batch record page.
- Breeding pigs (`/pig/sows`) are grouped table sections. The row is the record
  navigation target. Do not reintroduce the old PigTile/Record-button/modal-only
  workflow.
- Breeding-pig record pages use `pig.breeder` and mount Comments + Activity.
- Pig weigh-in record pages render entries in a dense table, not cards/badges.
  The leftmost column is the send-to-trip checkbox for eligible draft rows;
  sent/transferred rows are locked in-row. Weight/note autosave, prior weight,
  days, delta, ADG, undo send, transfer to breeding, undo transfer, and delete
  remain preserved.
- `/pig/weighins` is a navigation list split into Active and Complete sections.
  Pig list saved views, CSV export, Print, and status filters are intentionally
  removed. Broiler weigh-in lists keep the shared saved-view/export/print/filter
  behavior.

### Broiler, Layers, And Feed Planning

- Broiler batches live in `ppp-v4`.
- Broiler Batches filtering/sort/saved-views and the column/display picker are
  scoped to the PROCESSED table only; active/planned batches stay pinned above
  the controls. Filter/sort semantics live in the pure module
  `src/lib/broilerBatchFilters.js` (processing-date-desc default). Batch
  Comparison was removed - do not reintroduce it.
- Login-gated `/weighins` cannot read or mutate `app_store.ppp-v4` directly.
- Week 4/6 completion uses `stamp_broiler_batch_avg` RPC.
- Broiler batch record Week 4 and Week 6 weight fields are read-only display
  values sourced from completed weigh-ins via `loadBroilerBatchWeekAverages`;
  this is canonical for record display and prevents stale `ppp-v4` cache values
  from showing as "Not recorded."
- `ppp-v4.week4Lbs` / `week6Lbs` remain the mirror used by list/production
  surfaces. Admin/session-page write paths use `writeBroilerBatchAvg` and
  `recomputeBroilerBatchWeekAvg`; real `app_store` read/upsert failures must
  surface as `{ok:false,message}`. True no-data cases may no-op with
  `{ok:true}`.
- Broiler `persist(nb)` in `src/main.jsx` must keep the anonymous weigh-in
  webform mirrors fresh by calling
  `syncWebformConfig(null, null, nb, layerGroups, layerHousings)`.
- B-26-08 wk6 was repaired in PROD after the drift hardening deploy:
  `ppp-v4.week6Lbs` is 5.76 and matches canonical 5.76 from 30 completed
  weigh-in weights.
- Layer `current_count` is the physical anchor; projected count subtracts
  mortalities since anchor. Layer housing record surfaces now label the
  displayed count as live hens and use the projected live count when the raw
  physical anchor is stale/empty but daily-count history provides a valid
  anchor; Eggmobile 3 / `L-25-01` displays 112 live hens from anchor 115 minus
  three mortalities.
- Feed math lives in `src/lib/feedPlanner.js` and `src/lib/feedOrderBasis.js`.
- Feed-order recommendations use the latest active-month physical count when
  present; otherwise they fall back to previous-month estimate.
- Poultry feed-order math is per feed type: starter, grower, layerfeed.
- "Count includes `<month>` order" prevents double-counting the delivery.
- The feed-order board is calendar-pinned. Pig and broiler both show the next
  calendar month order card until the calendar advances; saving the order does
  not advance the visible board to the following month.
- The second feed summary tile for pig and broiler stays pinned to the current
  calendar month estimate via `estTileYM`.
- Broiler on-farm counts are centralized in `computeBroilerOnFarmCounts`.
- Broiler batch status auto-advances in `loadAllData`: planned -> active on/after
  hatch date, active -> processed on/after processing date.

### Tasks

- `/tasks` is canonical. `/my-tasks` and `/admin/tasks` are aliases only.
- Task writes go through v2 wrappers/RPCs.
- Frontend must not call `generate_system_task_instance`; `tasks-cron` is the
  runtime caller for system-task generation.
- System task rules live in `task_system_rules`; assignee and active state stay
  data-driven there, and the cron uses `lead_time_days` as the minting horizon.
- `tasks-cron` is deployed and active in PROD. The deployed function includes
  system-task generation with batch/group entity labels plus To Do approval/
  originator notifications; the daily cron remains `tasks-cron-daily` at
  `0 4 * * *` UTC through `public.invoke_tasks_cron()`.
- Existing open system-generated task titles were backfilled by migration `142`;
  newly generated system tasks get titles in the form
  `<rule name> - <entity label>`.
- `task_instance_photos` is canonical. Legacy single-photo columns are display
  fallback only.
- Task photos are capped at 5 total per task across creation and completion;
  migration `114` is the DB backstop.
- To Do List lives inside Task Center at `/tasks/todo` and `/tasks/todo/<id>`.
- To Do participants are `light`, `farm_team`, `management`, and `admin`;
  `equipment_tech` and inactive are excluded.
- Non-manager To Do completion submissions enter `pending_approval` and notify
  management/admin; approval or auto-approval notifies the To Do creator.

### Equipment

- Logged-in equipment lives under `/fleet`.
- Login-gated equipment checklist/fueling lives under `/equipment`.
- Equipment fueling submissions use `submit_equipment_fueling` RPC.
- Light My Submissions edits/deletes its own equipment fuelings and fuel
  supplies through ownership RPCs.
- Fuel-log edit/delete paths recompute current readings from remaining fuel logs.
- Equipment checklist/material edits must not reload, lose focus, or reorder list
  items on click/edit.
- Admin client error review is at `/admin/client-errors` and reads through
  `list_client_errors` only.

### Login-Gated Webforms And Offline Queue

- Login-gated webforms must not read `app_store` directly or use browser
  secrets.
- Former public forms now use Supabase auth state intentionally for login and
  locked submitter identity.
- Light is allowed only on contained report/form surfaces plus pasture
  farm-team-level `/pasture-map` access. Weigh-ins and Production remain outside
  the Light allowlist.
- Offline queue IndexedDB ownership is centralized in `src/lib/offlineQueue.js`.
- Offline RPC replay goes through `useOfflineRpcSubmit` where needed.
- Ownership stamping is server-side on replay.
- Shared TEST DB Playwright specs that reset/seed the DB must run one file at a
  time.

### Storage And File Inputs

- Upload owner/count guards are intentionally brittle.
- New upload/remove/signed/public URL owners require updating the matching static
  guard.
- Task, daily, and comment attachment uploads are append-only.
- Image file inputs intentionally omit `capture=` so mobile users can choose
  camera or library upload through the native picker.

### Runtime Observability

- `client_error_events` records redacted browser/runtime errors through
  `record_client_error`.
- `/admin/client-errors` is read-only, admin-gated, fail-closed, paginated, and
  uses `list_client_errors`.
- Client error reporting must not store raw localStorage, auth tokens, full
  payloads, or secret-like data.

### Shared UI And Record Chrome

- Global openable affordance is shared through `.hoverable-tile` for card/div
  openables and `.hoverable-row` for table-row openables.
- Do not put `.hoverable-tile` on `<tr>` or `.hoverable-row` on non-`tr`
  elements.
- `RecordPageShell` owns record-page frame/loading/not-found/body/title chrome.
- `RecordCollaborationSection` is the only component that composes
  `CommentsSection` and `RecordActivityLog`.
- `RecordActivityLog` is audit-only and filters `comment.posted`.
- `RecordSequenceNav` is the shared sequence-navigation primitive.
- `DataTable` owns table/list rendering for comparable records: real `<table>`,
  sticky header, `.hoverable-row` row-open, fail-closed load/error/empty states,
  optional row selection, Active/Complete `SectionBand`s, and mobile stacked
  record-lines.
- `Badge` is for true lifecycle/status labels only. Use `StatusText` for inline
  soft signals and supporting status ink.
- Program/species accents come from `src/lib/programColors.js` and should appear
  as dots, selected pills, or rare headline accents, not as status badges or
  broad surface themes.
- `Toolbar` owns page action bars; `Tabs` owns in-page tab strips. Header
  section navigation remains owned by `Header.jsx`.
- `app_saved_views` saved views are a generic per-surface primitive.
- `DeleteModal` and `ConfirmModal` are app-level modal primitives.
- CSV export ownership lives in `csvExport.js`; row-print export ownership lives
  in `printExport.js`.
- Record page controls live in `src/shared/recordPageControls.jsx`.

### Source Boundary Guards

Static guards lock these boundaries. If a legitimate new owner is added, update
the guard in the same lane and explain why:

- Supabase client owner.
- Browser secret/env usage.
- `app_store`, `webform_config`, `profiles` access.
- `localStorage` owner/key inventory.
- IndexedDB/offline queue owner.
- Notifications client-write prohibition.
- Task API boundary.
- Comments/Activity table access.
- Route alias ownership.
- Light portal/access boundary.
- Login-gated webforms boundary.
- Storage upload/remove/signed/public URL ownership.
- Append-only bucket upload contracts.
- Image file input capture contract.
- Hard-delete owner inventory.
- Mutation semantics inventory.
- CP2 daily writes via ownership RPCs.
- Delete/recovery classification.
- Legacy Activity retirement.
- Load/retry readiness inventory.
- Design token and radius-floor contracts.
- Shared UI extraction contract.
- Openable hover affordance contract.

Playwright notes:

- Specs that reset the shared TEST DB must run one file at a time.
- Local dev-server cold-start can hang if stray node/vite processes remain in
  old worktrees. Clear stale processes before diagnosing product flake.

## Agent Session Checklist

Before a new lane:

1. Read [HO.md](HO.md).
2. Read Current State, Build Queue, and the relevant contracts here.
3. Run `git status --short`, `git worktree list`, and inspect recent `git log`.
4. Identify dirty-tree risk, active worktrees, open gates, and migration state.
5. Inspect files in scope before planning.
6. If touching a boundary guard, update the guard in the same lane.
7. If touching SQL/RPC/RLS/Storage, state TEST/PROD apply and verification needs
   in the plan.
8. If approving a commit gate, queue the next CC-ready prompt in the same Codex
   response per [HO.md](HO.md).

## Archives

- Older narrative history: `archive/SESSION_LOG.md`.
- Research, screenshots, audits, and video evaluations:
  `C:\Users\Ronni\cc-research\` (workstation-local; outside the repo, so it will
  not resolve on another clone/agent).
- Parity audit evidence:
  `C:\Users\Ronni\cc-research\parity-audit-2026-06-05-CC.md` (workstation-local).
- Detailed build history lives in git log and tests. Keep this file as the
  compact project map, not a running transcript.
