# WCF Planner

Farm-management web app for White Creek Farm. React/Vite single-page app,
Supabase backend, Netlify production deploy from GitHub `main`.

This file is the durable project map: current state, architecture, roadmap, and
load-bearing contracts. Workflow, roles, gates, and relay format live in
[HO.md](HO.md). Do not turn this file into a session transcript.

Last updated: 2026-06-17.
Current shipped runtime checkpoint: `f09e72c`
(`Merge pasture map line usability`), pushed to `origin/main`.
This `PROJECT.md` wrap update is the only local tracked change in the active
IDE worktree until Ronnie approves a docs commit/push.
Production URL: https://wcfplanner.com.
Latest verified live bundle: `assets/main-BCZWU8T2.js` /
`assets/main-BOVfSEOD.css`.

---

## Start Here

1. Read [HO.md](HO.md) for workflow, roles, gates, relay format, and
   parallel-worktree rules.
2. Read this file's Current State, Build Queue, and the relevant contracts.
3. Run `git status --short`, `git worktree list`, and inspect recent `git log`
   before planning or editing.
4. Inspect the source/test/migration files in scope before changing anything.

Default session model: Codex plans/reviews, CC builds/validates, Ronnie approves
commit/push/PROD gates. Ronnie may explicitly assign Codex build work; otherwise
CC is the primary builder.

## Project Map Governance

This file is a docs-as-code project map, not a session log, scratchpad, or
append-only changelog.

Rules for editing this file:

- Build Queue is the only home for outstanding build/design work. Do not hide
  "future", "needs", "still needs", "TODO", or "TBD" work in later sections.
- Contract sections describe current architecture, standards, and guard rails.
  If a contract is aspirational rather than true, move the work to Build Queue
  and state the current guard/inventory honestly.
- Current State summarizes what is true now, including active local worktree risk
  when it matters. Latest Shipped Checkpoint summarizes work merged to
  `origin/main`.
- Inventory counts, migration state, test names, and owner lists must match the
  source/static guards at the time of edit. Prefer pointing to the guard as the
  source of truth instead of duplicating fragile counts.
- Every Build Queue item should state class (`DEFECT`, `DECISION`, `ENH`),
  scope, success criteria, validation/guard target, and any migration/PROD gate
  once it is promoted into an active lane.
- Remove or reconcile stale text instead of appending corrections nearby.
- Normal build/hotfix lanes must not edit this file unless Ronnie explicitly
  requests docs, wrap, or a named `PROJECT.md` change.

Design/function invariants that govern cross-surface behavior live in
`## Global Decisions (Constitution)` and `## Design System`.

---

## Current State

- Production deploy: Netlify auto-deploys from GitHub `main`.
- Shipped source: `origin/main` at `f09e72c`
  (`Merge pasture map line usability`).
- Active IDE worktree: `C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner` is on
  `feature/ui-cleanup-conversions` at `cb7aaee`, clean before this docs wrap,
  and behind `origin/main` by `bb77739`/`f09e72c` (Pasture Map line usability).
  Sync or merge `origin/main` before building from this worktree.
- Codex pasture worktree:
  `C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner-codex-pasture-map-completion` is on `main` at
  `f09e72c` and tracks `origin/main`. It has only untracked screenshot folders:
  `pasture-cp2-shots/`, `pasture-data-mock-shots/`, and
  `pasture-map-shots/`.
- Other old worktrees:
  `C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner-codex-compact-controls` on
  `codex/compact-list-controls` and
  `C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner-pasture-cp2` on
  `feature/pasture-map-cp2-draw-edit` contain no unique commits ahead of
  `origin/main`; they can be pruned when Ronnie wants. The CP2 worktree has
  untracked pasture screenshot folders.
- Open gates: no code, migration, Storage, Vault, Edge Function, commit, merge,
  or push gate is open. This docs wrap itself is the only local tracked change
  in the active IDE worktree until Ronnie approves a docs commit/push.
- PROD-applied recent migrations include `112` through `116`, `125`, `126`, and
  Pasture Map `127` through `132`. PROD verification on 2026-06-17 confirmed
  `list_pasture_moves`, `list_pasture_stocking_report`,
  `create_land_area_track`, `land_areas.line_weight`,
  `land_areas.line_pattern`, and `update_land_area_line_style` exist.
- Production legacy import: `Processing Events - ALL.xlsx` parsed 69 rows,
  skipped 0, and upserted 69 rows into `production_legacy_events` on PROD by
  stable `source_key`.
- Pasture Map PROD state: CP1 through CP7 plus line-style usability are present.
  Current imported OnX linework was restyled in PROD by migration `132`;
  verification showed 4/4 imported line rows are red, solid, 5px. OnX KML
  files, drawn areas, field tracks, moves, planned moves, and reports should be
  created/reviewed through `/pasture-map`.
- Latest validation for the shipped pasture line-style merge:
  - `npm test -- tests/static/pasture_map_static.test.js
    tests/static/radius_floor_static.test.js src/lib/pastureGeometry.test.js
    src/lib/pastureKml.test.js`: 79 passed.
  - `npm run build`: green with existing Vite chunk-size/dynamic-import
    warnings.
  - `npx playwright test -c playwright.pasture.config.js`: 9 passed after
    loading TEST env from the main checkout.
- Latest live verification: `wcfplanner.com/index.html` served
  `assets/main-BCZWU8T2.js` and `assets/main-BOVfSEOD.css`.
- `npm install` was run in the main worktree after Pasture Map dependencies
  landed. It reported npm audit findings (11 vulnerabilities: 1 low, 3
  moderate, 6 high, 1 critical). No audit-fix lane has been scoped.

### Latest Shipped Checkpoint

The following work is merged to `main`, pushed, and live unless otherwise noted:

- Site-wide Home aesthetic parity rollout:
  - Foundation/global token layer and shared openable hover primitives.
  - Admin, activity, webforms, equipment, Task Center, To Do, cattle, sheep, pig,
    broiler, layer, and livestock parity slices.
  - Program identity colors remain small accents; broad pastel fills were
    reduced where scoped. Green Header chrome remains.
  - Guard repairs closed stale assumptions around z-index, task photo ownership,
    My Submissions, webforms, record-page shell, and openable hover.
- Feed-order month hotfix:
  - Pig and broiler feed boards use the same calendar-pinned order-month rule.
  - "Order for `<month>`" stays on the next calendar month until the calendar
    advances; saving an order no longer rolls the board to the following month.
  - Source owner: `src/lib/feedOrderBasis.js` (`calendarOrderYM`).
- Breeding pigs parity:
  - Breeding pigs are table-based by group, not modal/card Record-button tiles.
  - Table rows open `/pig/sows/<id>` with hover affordance.
  - Breeding-pig record pages mount Comments + Activity via `pig.breeder`.
  - Migration `126` adds `pig.breeder` to the Activity read/write resolver and
    is PROD-applied.
- Animals on Farm snapshot hotfix:
  - Home uses the shared current animal snapshot logic and no longer carries the
    stale layer-count import.
  - Animals on Farm page remains the monthly history/detail view.
- Production page:
  - Home Production card opens `/production`.
  - No combined total exists anywhere; totals are per program only.
  - Year-over-year values are per program/year.
  - Processing Events, Egg Events, and Legacy/Audit Review are collapsed
    sections.
  - Production data auto-updates from Planner sources plus the legacy
    spreadsheet backfill. Planner wins by program/year coverage: when Planner
    has events for a program/year, Planner is the counted total and legacy rows
    are held as audit/backfill; legacy counts only for program/years with no
    Planner events.
  - The page no longer displays Podio terminology, Raw-Podio columns, or
    delta-vs-Podio columns.
  - Light users are excluded from `/production`.
  - Migration `125` and the 69-row legacy import are PROD-applied.
- Pig weigh-ins:
  - Pig weigh-in record pages render entries as dense tables, not card/badge
    grids.
  - The send-to-trip control is the leftmost row checkbox; the existing
    `Send N to Trip` modal/action flow is preserved.
  - `/pig/weighins` is split into Active and Complete sections. Pig list saved
    views, CSV export, Print, and status filters are removed. Broiler weigh-ins
    keep the shared saved-view/export/print/filter behavior.
- Pasture Map CP1 through CP7 + line usability:
  - Home shows a Pasture Map button beside Weather above Processing/Admin.
  - `/pasture-map` renders the map/import/draw/edit/measure/track surface.
  - Client parses OnX KML with `@tmcw/togeojson`; Polygons import as reviewable
    areas; LineStrings import as outline candidates and are never auto-closed.
  - Read access starts at `farm_team`; management/admin can import/classify/
    close/delete, draw/edit geometry, and change line styles. Farm-team users
    can view, measure, and create GPS field tracks. Light users are excluded.
  - Map rendering uses Leaflet with USGS/NAIP imagery. Geometry is provider-
    neutral GeoJSON/PostGIS; Google is not the geometry source.
  - Draw/edit uses Leaflet-Geoman with snapping, a measure HUD, client
    self-intersection warnings, and DB-side validity checks.
  - Geometry edits are append-only versions and preserve manual acreage override
    separately from computed geodesic acreage.
  - Move ledger records current animal-group locations and derives occupancy,
    rest state, rest days, history, stocking density, and animal-days/acre
    reports.
  - Planned moves support same-day warning prompts and completion/cancel status.
  - Offline field use includes vector snapshot cache, queued move logging,
    field-created paddocks, and queued GPS field tracks. Offline imagery cache
    is intentionally not built.
  - Mobile GPS tracking creates outline-candidate LineStrings. Default track
    style is white, dashed, 5px.
  - Managers/admins can set boundary color, weight, and pattern
    (solid/dashed/dotted). Imported OnX linework defaults to red, solid, 5px.
  - Move mode is separate from Select; Edit has an explicit `Exit edit` action.
  - Migrations `116` and `127` through `132` are PROD-applied. No daily-report
    wiring exists for pasture yet.

## Build Queue

Treat these as product lanes, not hotfixes, unless Ronnie says otherwise.
This is the canonical home for outstanding build/design work.

1. Site-Wide Cleanup / Redesign Conversion Decision
   - Class: `DECISION`/`ENH`.
   - Current state: the safe cleanup core (`feature/ui-cleanup-core`) is merged
     to `main` via `59bc089`, but the heavier table/surface conversion effort
     must not be treated as automatically safe.
   - Known risk from CC report: tile/card -> DataTable conversions created real
     e2e debt across heavily tested surfaces. Failures are not a mechanical
     selector sweep; each spec needs investigation for selector drift vs.
     genuine behavior regression.
   - Decision needed before further broad conversion work: grind full e2e
     reconciliation, land only safe core, rethink conversion scope, or review
     the conversion diff/screenshots first.
   - Worktree note: active IDE worktree is `feature/ui-cleanup-conversions` at
     `cb7aaee` and is behind `origin/main` by the pasture line-usability merge.
     Sync from `origin/main` before continuing this lane.
   - Gate: no PROD DB work expected unless a touched surface introduces new SQL.

2. Pasture Map Follow-Up Decisions
   - Class: `DECISION`/`ENH`.
   - Current state: CP1 through CP7 plus line usability are shipped and
     PROD-applied through migration `132`.
   - Possible follow-ups only if Ronnie asks: further mobile field ergonomics,
     map imagery/provider decision if Leaflet overzoom `26` is still not enough,
     pasture daily-report linkage, utilization/AUM conventions, or offline
     imagery cache.
   - Locked current behavior: offline vector snapshot/queue is built; offline
     imagery cache is not built. Tracks default to white dashed 5px. Imported
     OnX lines default to red solid 5px.
   - Gate: imagery provider/offline imagery needs explicit decision; SQL/RPC
     additions need TEST apply and PROD apply approval.

3. Parity Residuals
   - Class: `ENH`.
   - Known small follow-ups from the parity rollout:
     HomeDashboard admin Last-5-Days inline block, cattle herd-color owner
     reconciliation, and SheepDailysView flock row-badge residual.
   - Scope each separately; do not reopen a full site-wide parity pass without a
     new audit.
   - Gate: code-only unless a touched surface needs a guard update.

4. Dependency Audit Lane
   - Class: `DEFECT`/`ENH`.
   - Scope: review `npm audit` findings after the 2026-06-15 dependency install.
   - Success criteria: identify direct vs transitive vulnerabilities, decide
     safe upgrades, avoid breaking Vite/React/Supabase/Playwright toolchain.
   - Gate: code/dependency lockfile push; no PROD DB work expected.

## Global Decisions (Constitution)

The following decisions are locked and govern future builds. New code and
surface changes MUST conform unless this section is amended.

Rules:

- No surface may silently diverge from a locked decision. New exceptions MUST be
  added to `## Intentional Non-Uniformities` with justification.
- Changing any locked decision requires a Ronnie-approved amendment in this file
  and the relevant guard update in the same change.
- The entire `## Design System` section is part of the Constitution.

| Decision | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Font scale | Ratified; shared-token enforcement active, residual legacy drift only by scoped lane | `design_token_contract_static.test.js`, `record_page_shell_static.test.js` |
| Button corners | Ratified; `7`/`8` retired | `design_token_contract_static.test.js` |
| Confirm/Delete stacking | Ratified; top destructive overlay tier | `design_token_contract_static.test.js`, `shared_ui_extraction_contract_static.test.js` |
| Button height/padding | Ratified; standard button pad `10px 16px` | `design_token_contract_static.test.js` |
| Save model | Ratified; submit-style vs autosave split | `save_model_contract_static.test.js` |
| Ordinary text hierarchy | Ratified; Home and parity rollout shipped | `homeRedesign.css`, parity commits through `669fefc` |

Locked functional invariants:

| Invariant | Contract section | Guard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single Supabase client owner; no unapproved browser secrets | Cross-App Rules | `supabase_client_owner_static.test.js`, `browser_secret_boundary_static.test.js` |
| Permissions enforced by RLS/RPC, never UI alone | Authentication And Roles | `light_user_portal_static.test.js` and per-surface guards |
| Route aliases only in `src/lib/routes.js` | Route Ownership | `url_alias_redirects.spec.js` |
| Fail-closed loading order | Cold-Boot And Fail-Closed Loading | `load_retry_robustness_inventory_static.test.js` |
| Audit-critical mutations through SECDEF RPCs | Entity Mutations And Audit Atomicity | `mutation_semantics_inventory_static.test.js` |
| Daily edits/deletes through ownership RPCs | Daily Reports | `cp2_daily_writes_via_rpc_static.test.js` |
| One canonical component per UI role | Shared UI And Record Chrome | `shared_ui_extraction_contract_static.test.js` |

---

## Intentional Non-Uniformities

These differences are current product/architecture decisions, not parity defects
unless Ronnie changes the contract:

- Light users are intentionally excluded from `/weighins`, `/production`, and
  `/pasture-map`.
- Light users may access Cattle Log through the webform/field-journal path.
- Migration `083` public webform submitter identity stays shelved. Authenticated
  submitter identity is the durable path.
- `/webform-pigs` remains a valid legacy standalone pig daily form route/alias.
- `egg_dailys` has warning/pre-submit duplicate prevention only; it is not
  covered by the daily unique-index backstop.
- Add Feed quick-log rows are not full daily reports, and missed-report checks
  exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Broiler, layer, and pig daily pages use Group copy rather than Batch copy.
- Pig planned-trip forecast weights are render-only. Latest weigh-ins do not
  change planned-trip forecast weights automatically.
- Program dashboards may show program-specific KPIs.
- The public `#webform-container` CSS island is intentionally separate from the
  React app tokens.
- The homepage redesign remains scoped under `.home.theme-crisp`; do not move
  Home-specific non-canonical micro-values globally without an amendment.
- `getReadableText()` in `src/lib/styles.js` returns infrastructure contrast
  colors for arbitrary colored backgrounds; this is not palette drift.

---

## Product Surface

### Authenticated App

- Home dashboard: `.home.theme-crisp` landing surface with label-only program
  tiles, Pasture Map + Weather field row, Processing/Admin utility row, Animals
  on Farm, Production, missed-daily/equipment/material alerts, Next 30 Days, and
  admin Last-5-Days.
- `/animals-on-farm`: newest-first monthly species counts and multi-series line
  graph for Broilers, Layer Hens, Pigs, Cattle, Sheep, and Total. History range
  starts Oct 2024.
- `/production`: per-program production totals, per-program YoY, processing
  events, egg events, and legacy/audit review. Planner wins by program/year
  coverage; legacy is silent backfill where Planner has no events. No combined
  total ever.
- `/pasture-map`: field map surface for OnX KML import, land-area review,
  classification, outline close, draw/edit/snap/measure, GPS field tracks,
  move logging, planned moves, rest/occupancy reports, line styling, acreage
  display, GPS locate, offline vector queueing, and NAIP imagery.
- Broiler: home, timeline, batches, feed, dailys, weigh-ins.
- Pig: home, breeding, farrowing, breeding pigs, batches, feed, dailys,
  weigh-ins with table-based session records and Active/Complete list sections.
- Layer: home, groups, batches, dailys, eggs.
- Cattle: home, herds, breeding, forecast, processing batches, dailys,
  weigh-ins, Cattle Log.
- Sheep: home, flocks, processing batches, dailys, weigh-ins.
- Equipment/Fleet: `/fleet` with fleet list, fuel log, and equipment detail;
  `/equipment` remains the login-gated fueling/checklist hub.
- Task Center: `/tasks`, with To Do List at `/tasks/todo` and record pages at
  `/tasks/todo/<id>`.
- Light portal: contained home for `role=light`, allowed webform/daily
  shortcuts, Tasks, My Submissions/View Past Reports, equipment public hub, fuel
  supply, Add Feed, legacy pig daily, and Cattle Log. No Production, Pasture Map,
  or Weigh-ins.
- Global Activity: `/activity`.
- Admin/config: `/admin`.
- Admin runtime observability: `/admin/client-errors`.

### Login-Gated Form URLs

- Former public report/form URLs are authenticated. Existing paths and aliases
  stay valid, redirect logged-out users to login, and return to the requested URL
  after auth.
- `/dailys` and `/dailys/tasks`.
- `/addfeed`.
- `/weighins`.
- `/equipment` and `/equipment/<slug>`.
- `/fuel-supply`.
- `/webform-pigs`.
- Legacy aliases redirect through `src/lib/routes.js`.

### Operational Record Pages

Record pages are durable per-entity workspaces. They own record details,
Comments, collapsed Activity log, sequence navigation where appropriate, and
fail-closed loading.

Live Activity entity types and routes:

| Entity type | Route |
| --- | --- |
| `task.instance` | `/tasks/<id>` |
| `todo.item` | `/tasks/todo/<id>` |
| `cattle.animal` | `/cattle/herds/<id>` |
| `sheep.animal` | `/sheep/flocks/<id>` |
| `cattle.processing` | `/cattle/batches/<id>` |
| `sheep.processing` | `/sheep/batches/<id>` |
| `broiler.batch` | `/broiler/batches/<encoded name>` |
| `pig.batch` | `/pig/batches/<group id>` |
| `pig.breeder` | `/pig/sows/<id>` |
| `layer.batch` | `/layer/batches/<id>` |
| `layer.housing` | `/layer/housings/<id>` |
| `equipment.item` | `/fleet/<id>` |
| `poultry.daily` | `/broiler/dailys/<id>` |
| `layer.daily` | `/layer/dailys/<id>` |
| `egg.daily` | `/layer/eggs/<id>` |
| `pig.daily` | `/pig/dailys/<id>` |
| `cattle.daily` | `/cattle/dailys/<id>` |
| `sheep.daily` | `/sheep/dailys/<id>` |
| `weighin.session` | `/weigh-in-sessions/<id>` |
| `cattle.forecast` | `/cattle/forecast` |
| `cattle.breeding` | `/cattle/breeding` |
| `cattle.log` | `/cattle/log` |

No operational record workspace should reintroduce legacy `ActivityPanel` or
`ActivityModal`. Comments are discussion; Activity is audit/history.

---

## Backend And Data State

### Stack

- React 18 / Vite SPA.
- Supabase JS client from `src/lib/supabase.js` only.
- React Router DOM.
- `idb` for IndexedDB/offline queue.
- Leaflet for Pasture Map rendering; Leaflet-Geoman powers draw/edit/snap/
  measure controls.
- Vitest for unit/static tests.
- Playwright for e2e.
- ESLint + Prettier.
- Netlify production deploy from `main`.

### Supabase Migrations

Current PROD architecture includes all applied migrations through `116`, plus
`125`, `126`, and Pasture Map `127` through `132`. Recent load-bearing
migrations:

- `100` processing batch lifecycle RPCs.
- `101`-`104` audited delete RPCs and hardening.
- `105` recurring task template creation RPC.
- `106` delete layer batch RPC.
- `107` delete fuel bill RPC.
- `108` delete feed input RPC.
- `109` drop dead daily-photo anon insert policy.
- `110` cattle calf-row heifer promotion.
- `111` weigh-in note -> canonical comment mirror.
- `112` cattle log sidecar tables/RPCs/triggers.
- `113` Light daily report 3-day own-record edit/delete window.
- `114` task photo 5-total DB backstop.
- `115` Task Center To Do List schema/RPCs/photos/mentions/digest fields.
- `116` Pasture Map CP1:
  - `pasture_import_batches`, self-referencing `land_areas`, and append-only
    `land_area_geometry_versions`.
  - PostGIS in `extensions` schema; geometry stored as 4326; acreage via
    `ST_Area(geom::geography)`.
  - Deny-all RLS; access only through SECURITY DEFINER RPCs.
  - `list_land_areas` read gate: `farm_team`, `management`, `admin`.
  - Import/classify/close/delete gates: `management`, `admin`.
  - OnX UUID becomes `source_external_id`; re-import updates, not duplicates.
  - Polygons import as `unclassified`/`pending_review`; LineStrings import as
    `outline_candidate`; no auto-close; invalid polygons are flagged, not fixed.
  - No fabricated last-grazed date; `baseline_no_history` is distinct.
- `125` Production legacy events:
  - `production_legacy_events` table with deny-all RLS.
  - `list_production_legacy_events(date,date)` SECURITY DEFINER read RPC.
  - Read gate: `farm_team`, `management`, `admin`; Light excluded.
  - Spreadsheet importer upserts by stable `source_key`; 69 rows imported to
    PROD on 2026-06-15.
- `126` Breeding-pig Activity entity:
  - Adds `pig.breeder` to `_activity_can_read` / `_activity_can_write`.
  - Existence check is `app_store` key `ppp-breeders-v1`, object id match.
  - Program access gate is `pig`.
- `127` Pasture Map CP2 draw/edit:
  - Adds `create_land_area(text,text,jsonb,text,text)` and
    `update_land_area_geometry(text,jsonb)` SECURITY DEFINER RPCs.
  - Management/admin only; EXECUTE granted to `authenticated` and revoked from
    `PUBLIC`/`anon`.
  - Reuses `_land_area_add_version`; edits append a new geometry version and
    stamp version source as `drawn`, while preserving the original area source
    in raw payload.
  - Validates polygon/multipolygon GeoJSON and rejects invalid/self-
    intersecting geometry; acreage remains geodesic.
  - PROD-applied on 2026-06-16 with schema reload and structural/PostgREST anon
    permission smokes. No PROD land-area rows were created.
- `128` Pasture Map move ledger:
  - Adds append-only `pasture_move_events` and `pasture_move_impacts`.
  - `record_pasture_move` / `list_pasture_moves` are SECURITY DEFINER RPCs.
  - Animal groups are decoupled from livestock tables by `animal_type`,
    `group_key`, and `group_label`.
  - Current occupancy, rest days, rest state, last touched, and last moved-out
    are exposed through `_land_area_summary`.
- `129` Pasture Map planned moves and reports:
  - Adds `pasture_planned_moves`.
  - Adds planned-move RPCs plus history, rest, and stocking report RPCs.
  - Reports include paddock/group history, exact rested day counts, and
    animal-days per acre.
- `130` Pasture Map field GPS tracks:
  - Adds `create_land_area_track(text,text,jsonb,text)` SECURITY DEFINER RPC.
  - Saves LineString/MultiLineString field tracks as `outline_candidate` land
    areas.
  - Read/write gate allows `farm_team`, `management`, and `admin`.
- `131` Pasture Map boundary line style:
  - Adds `land_areas.line_color` and `land_areas.line_weight`.
  - Exposes line style fields through `_land_area_summary`.
- `132` Pasture Map line patterns and defaults:
  - Adds `land_areas.line_pattern` constrained to `solid`, `dashed`, `dotted`.
  - Adds `update_land_area_line_style(text,text,integer,text,boolean)`.
  - Recreates `create_land_area_track` so field tracks default to white,
    dashed, 5px.
  - Restyles existing imported OnX LineString/MultiLineString rows to red,
    solid, 5px. PROD apply on 2026-06-17 updated 4 rows and verification showed
    4/4 imported line rows matched the requested style.

Special migration notes:

- `082` is intentionally unused.
- `083` public webform submitter identity is shelved.
- `085` was applied before `084` in PROD so duplicate active daily identities
  were cleaned up before unique indexes.
- `061_daily_report_soft_delete_restore.sql` is superseded by `067`.
- New or changed SECDEF RPC return shapes need `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`.
- PROD `exec_sql` is forbidden. Apply PROD SQL with `psql` and
  `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` per [HO.md](HO.md).

### Storage Buckets And Media

Known document/photo surfaces are locked by static guards:

- `daily-photos`.
- `task-photos`.
- `task-request-photos`.
- `comment-photos`.
- `equipment-maintenance-docs`.
- `fuel-bills`.
- `cattle-feed-pdfs`.
- `batch-documents`.

Append-only upload expectations:

- Uploads use `upsert: false` unless a lane explicitly changes the contract.
- Duplicate-object errors are treated as retry success where the upload path is
  idempotent.
- Private buckets use signed URLs; public buckets use public URLs.
- No code should mutate `storage.objects` directly.

### Important Files

- `src/main.jsx`: app shell, view routing, auth-gated view rendering, global
  modals.
- `src/lib/routes.js`: canonical route map and aliases.
- `src/dashboard/HomeDashboard.jsx` and `src/dashboard/homeRedesign.css`: Home
  dashboard and scoped Home styling.
- `src/dashboard/ProductionPage.jsx`, `src/lib/production.js`, and
  `src/lib/productionApi.js`: Production page, reconciliation, and data loading.

### Route Ownership

- `src/lib/routes.js` owns canonical paths and legacy aliases.
- `src/lib/activityRegistry.js` owns entity-to-record routes for Activity and
  notifications.
- `main.jsx` adapts URLs into view state. Do not add separate alias maps in
  views.

### Authentication And Roles

- Ronnie remains final gate owner.
- App roles include `admin`, `management`, `farm_team`, `equipment_tech`,
  `light`, and `inactive`.
- Runtime permission decisions must be enforced by RLS/RPCs, not just hidden UI.
- Report/form submission is login-required. The session user is the submitter;
  `owner_profile_id` is stamped server-side and client-supplied profile IDs are
  not trusted.
- Light allowlist excludes `/production`, `/pasture-map`, `/weighins`, program
  dashboards, `/fleet`, `/activity`, `/admin`, and client-error review.

## Design System

### Typography

- Canonical font family: self-hosted `Hanken Grotesk`.
- Canonical font-size set: `10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 26`.
- Allowed display sizes: `32, 34, 36, 48, 56`.
- Canonical shared-component font-weight scale: `400, 500, 600, 700`.

### Color Hierarchy

- Ordinary main text uses pure black (`#000000`): primary section/card/row
  titles, labels, buttons, and primary animal or production numbers.
- Supporting text uses muted gray: helper copy, subtext, metadata, secondary
  labels, and non-primary category labels.
- Intentional accent/semantic text remains allowed where color carries meaning:
  warning/error/success/info states, weather rain/freeze cues, overdue labels,
  and text inside approved semantic pastel blocks.
- A text-color cleanup must be typography-only unless the build explicitly says
  it is redesigning the affected block's background.

### Spacing And Controls

- Standard button pad is `10px 16px`.
- Standard button vertical pad is `10px`.
- Inputs/selects/textareas use radius `6`, border `1px #d1d5db`, pad `8px 11px`,
  and brand focus treatment.

### Radius

- Canonical radius tokens are `4`, `6`, `10`, `14`, `999`, and `'50%'`.
- The values `7` and `8` are retired.

### Stacking And Elevation

- Dialog layer order keeps Confirm/Delete at toast `9000`; other overlays and
  modals remain below that tier in the shared z-index ladder.

### Save Model

- Explicit Save/Submit by surface class is mandatory for submit-style flows.
- Autosave is mandatory for edit-in-place flows.

### Canonical Components

- Use canonical role owners before introducing equivalent alternatives.
- Canonical owners include `RecordPageShell`, `RecordSequenceNav`,
  `recordPageControls`, `DeleteModal`, `ConfirmModal`, `InlineNotice`, and
  record collaboration primitives.

---

## Load-Bearing Contracts

### Cross-App Rules

- Do not bypass RLS with client-side assumptions.
- Do not add browser secrets beyond approved `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`,
  `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and approved dev/test flags.
- Do not create new Supabase clients outside `src/lib/supabase.js`.
- Do not use raw browser `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt` in product surfaces.
- Do not add route aliases outside `src/lib/routes.js`.
- Do not edit docs during normal build/hotfix lanes unless Ronnie explicitly
  asks for docs or wrap work.

### Cold-Boot And Fail-Closed Loading

Data surfaces must fail closed on load errors:

- Record pages render in this order: loading -> loadError -> not-found -> record.
- List/hub surfaces expose `data-<surface>-loaded` markers and gate rows/empty
  states behind `!loadError`.
- Load failures clear stale rows/state, show `InlineNotice`, and should provide a
  user-gated Retry.
- Sidecar reads may degrade best-effort only when the primary record/list load
  is valid.
- Header badge counts soft-fail; Header panel content fails closed.

### Activity, Comments, Mentions, Notifications

- Activity is audit/system history. Comments are user discussion.
- Runtime Activity access goes through SECDEF RPCs: `list_activity_events`,
  `list_global_activity`, `record_activity_event`, and domain-specific SECDEF
  RPCs that insert `activity_events`.
- No direct client `.from('activity_events')`, `.from('activity_mentions')`,
  `.from('comments')`, or `.from('comment_edits')`.
- Legacy Activity composer/count RPCs remain retired; do not use them.
- `RecordActivityLog` filters `comment.posted` and shows audit only.
- `CommentsSection` owns discussion, attachments, edit history, soft delete, and
  mentions.
- Mention bodies stay human-readable `@Name`; UUIDs do not appear in body text.
- Mention notifications route to the operational record page and target comment.
- Valid notification types: `task_completed`, `mention`, `comment_mention`.
- Notification writes happen inside SECDEF paths; client code must not insert or
  delete notifications.

### Activity Entity Additions

A new Activity entity requires all of this:

- SQL `_activity_can_read` branch.
- `activityRegistry` entry.
- Route/deep-link mapping.
- Permission and existence semantics.
- Record or workflow surface.
- Static test coverage.
- Activity/event logging strategy.

Workflow/worktable entities:

- `cattle.forecast` uses entity_id `cattle-forecast`; Forecast month bucket logs
  filter by `payload.month_key`.
- `cattle.breeding` uses entity_id `cattle-breeding`.
- These are table/workflow audit streams and are program-gated rather than
  row-existence gated.

### Entity Mutations And Audit Atomicity

- `runMutation` is for routine client-side mutations with best-effort Activity.
- `runMutation` must not know table names or business rules.
- `runMutation` is not transactional.
- Audit-critical delete/restore/transfer/status flows should move to SECDEF RPCs
  that mutate data and insert Activity in one transaction.
- Mutation inventory counts live in
  `mutation_semantics_inventory_static.test.js`.

### Delete, Restore, And Recovery

- Hard-delete owner inventory lives in `hard_delete_owner_static.test.js`.
- Soft-delete protected roots must not have direct client deletes: cattle,
  sheep, `cattle_dailys`, `sheep_dailys`, `poultry_dailys`, `layer_dailys`,
  `egg_dailys`, `pig_dailys`.
- Daily reports soft-delete through `soft_delete_daily_report` and restore
  through `restore_daily_report`.
- Cattle/sheep animals soft-delete/restore through their animal RPCs.
- Calving sub-row delete goes through `delete_cattle_calving_record`.

### Production

- Production means processed animals and eggs, not current inventory.
- There is no combined production total. Home and `/production` display per-
  program totals only.
- Production sources:
  - Broilers from `app_store.ppp-v4` processed/auto-processed batches.
  - Pigs from `app_store.ppp-feeders-v1.processingTrips`.
  - Cattle from `cattle_processing_batches.actual_process_date`.
  - Sheep from `sheep_processing_batches.actual_process_date`.
  - Eggs from `egg_dailys` counts, displayed as dozens.
  - Legacy backfill from `production_legacy_events`.
- Reconciliation: Planner wins by program/year coverage. If Planner has events
  for a program/year, Planner is the counted total and every legacy row for that
  same program/year is held out as audit/backfill, including rows that represent
  the same batch dated differently. If Planner has no events for a program/year,
  legacy rows count as backfill.
- Legacy audit rows still label matched, conflict, superseded, and coverage-held
  reasons for review.
- `/production` must not display Podio terminology, Raw-Podio columns, or
  delta-vs-Podio columns.
- YoY is per program/year, not across programs.
- Light users are excluded by route allowlist and RPC role gate.

### Pasture Map

- Pasture Map architecture is provider-neutral: GeoJSON/PostGIS owns geometry;
  Leaflet renders the client map; OnX KML and drawn polygons are input sources;
  Google is not the geometry source.
- `land_areas` is the single self-referencing land model. It can represent
  pasture > paddock and feeder-pig area > section > paddock.
- Geometry history is append-only in `land_area_geometry_versions`; editing a
  boundary writes a new version instead of mutating history.
- Species is decoupled from land. `designation` is only a hint; animal-group
  occupancy belongs to dated move events and impacts, not a FK on land.
- Imported/drawn land starts `baseline_no_history=true`; no fake last-grazed
  date is seeded.
- LineStrings are outline candidates and require human close/validation. Never
  auto-close an OnX LineString.
- Computed acreage is geodesic; note/manual acreage is cross-check/override, not
  geometry truth. Editing geometry must not overwrite manual acreage override.
- Draw/edit controls use Leaflet-Geoman. Snapping, live area/perimeter measure,
  and client self-intersection warnings are UI requirements; the migration `127`
  RPC validity gates are the database backstop.
- Move mode is the default pan/zoom mode. Select mode changes selected areas.
  Edit mode must have a visible exit path.
- Field GPS tracks are allowed for `farm_team`, `management`, and `admin`.
  Tracks save as outline candidates and default to white dashed 5px.
- Managers/admins can set line color, weight, and pattern. Pattern values are
  `solid`, `dashed`, or `dotted`. Imported OnX lines default to red solid 5px.
- Current occupancy and rest state come from the append-only move ledger. Rest
  day display uses exact day counts; no "60+ days" threshold copy.
- Planned moves, history, rest report, stocking report, and animal-days/acre
  are part of the shipped pasture surface.
- Offline field use includes cached vector outlines and queued move/area/track
  operations through the shared offline queue owner. Offline imagery cache is
  not built and must not be assumed.
- Access: `farm_team`, `management`, `admin` can read/view/measure; only
  `management` and `admin` can import/classify/close/delete/draw/edit/style;
  `light`, `equipment_tech`, and inactive are excluded.
- Current Pasture Map does not include pasture daily-report linkage,
  utilization/AUM convention math, or offline imagery cache.

### Daily Reports

- Daily reports have dedicated record pages for poultry, layer, egg, pig, cattle,
  and sheep.
- All six open directly editable; no edit-mode toggle.
- Daily duplicate prevention is DB-backed for poultry/pig/layer/cattle/sheep by
  partial unique indexes (`084`) after cleanup (`085`); egg duplicate prevention
  is warning/pre-submit only.
- Add Feed quick-log rows are not full daily reports.
- Missed-report checks exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Daily edits route through `updateDailyReport` / `update_daily_report`.
- Daily deletes route through `soft_delete_daily_report`.
- Light can edit/delete only own rows inside the server-side window.

### Cattle And Sheep

- Cattle and sheep use dedicated Supabase tables, not `app_store`.
- Active cattle herds: `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, `bulls`.
- Active sheep flocks: `rams`, `ewes`, `feeders`.
- Outcome states are `processed`, `deceased`, `sold`.
- Heifer-to-cow promotion fires from both calving records and calf-row dam links.
- Manual transfer goes through `transfer_cattle_animal` /
  `transfer_sheep_animal`.
- Processing-batch unschedule/delete go through audited SECDEF RPCs
  `unschedule_cattle_processing_batch` / `delete_sheep_processing_batch`.
- Cattle Log (`/cattle/log`) is a comment-backed program field journal on the
  singleton `cattle.log` entity. It supports keyword search, @mentions, photo
  attachments, offline create replay, issue filters, and #tag mirrors.

### Pig

- Pig feeder group started counts are authoritative.
- Current count is ledger-derived, not persisted `currentCount`.
- `pig.batch` record pages own metadata, sub-batches, mortality, planned trips,
  processing trips, forecast/current/FCR, send-to-trip source display, Comments,
  and Activity.
- Keep pig batch workflow split across `PigBatchPage`, `PigBatchHubTile`,
  `usePigMortality`, `usePigSubBatches`, `usePigPlannedTrips`, and
  `usePigProcessingTrips`.
- `PigContext.feedersLoaded` is the readiness boundary.
- Farm-born feeder batches are created from farrowing cycles, not manually from
  `/pig/batches`.
- Planned-trip row shape stays `{id, date, sex, subBatchId, plannedCount,
  order}`.
- Planned-trip locks live only in `ppp-pig-planned-trip-locks-v1`.
- Planned-trip forecast weights are render-only and based on DOB/farrowing age
  at trip date times Global ADG.
- Pig Batches hub rows use the locked 14-column inspection grid and open the
  batch record page.
- Breeding pigs (`/pig/sows`) are grouped table sections. The row is the record
  navigation target. Do not reintroduce the old PigTile/Record-button/modal-only
  workflow.
- Breeding-pig record pages use `pig.breeder` and mount Comments + Activity.
- Pig weigh-in record pages render entries in a dense table, not cards/badges.
  The leftmost column is the send-to-trip checkbox for eligible draft rows;
  sent/transferred rows are locked in-row. Weight/note autosave, prior weight,
  days, delta, ADG, undo send, transfer to breeding, undo transfer, and delete
  remain preserved.
- `/pig/weighins` is a navigation list split into Active and Complete sections.
  Pig list saved views, CSV export, Print, and status filters are intentionally
  removed. Broiler weigh-in lists keep the shared saved-view/export/print/filter
  behavior.

### Broiler, Layers, And Feed Planning

- Broiler batches live in `ppp-v4`.
- Login-gated `/weighins` cannot read or mutate `app_store.ppp-v4` directly.
- Week 4/6 completion uses `stamp_broiler_batch_avg` RPC.
- Broiler batch record Week 4 and Week 6 weight fields are read-only display
  values sourced from completed weigh-ins.
- Layer `current_count` is the physical anchor; projected count subtracts
  mortalities since anchor.
- Feed math lives in `src/lib/feedPlanner.js` and `src/lib/feedOrderBasis.js`.
- Feed-order recommendations use the latest active-month physical count when
  present; otherwise they fall back to previous-month estimate.
- Poultry feed-order math is per feed type: starter, grower, layerfeed.
- "Count includes `<month>` order" prevents double-counting the delivery.
- The feed-order board is calendar-pinned. Pig and broiler both show the next
  calendar month order card until the calendar advances; saving the order does
  not advance the visible board to the following month.
- The second feed summary tile for pig and broiler stays pinned to the current
  calendar month estimate via `estTileYM`.
- Broiler on-farm counts are centralized in `computeBroilerOnFarmCounts`.
- Broiler batch status auto-advances in `loadAllData`: planned -> active on/after
  hatch date, active -> processed on/after processing date.

### Tasks

- `/tasks` is canonical. `/my-tasks` and `/admin/tasks` are aliases only.
- Task writes go through v2 wrappers/RPCs.
- Frontend must not call `generate_system_task_instance`.
- `task_instance_photos` is canonical. Legacy single-photo columns are display
  fallback only.
- Task photos are capped at 5 total per task across creation and completion;
  migration `114` is the DB backstop.
- To Do List lives inside Task Center at `/tasks/todo` and `/tasks/todo/<id>`.
- To Do participants are `light`, `farm_team`, `management`, and `admin`;
  `equipment_tech` and inactive are excluded.

### Equipment

- Logged-in equipment lives under `/fleet`.
- Login-gated equipment checklist/fueling lives under `/equipment`.
- Equipment fueling submissions use `submit_equipment_fueling` RPC.
- Light My Submissions edits/deletes its own equipment fuelings and fuel
  supplies through ownership RPCs.
- Fuel-log edit/delete paths recompute current readings from remaining fuel logs.
- Equipment checklist/material edits must not reload, lose focus, or reorder list
  items on click/edit.
- Admin client error review is at `/admin/client-errors` and reads through
  `list_client_errors` only.

### Login-Gated Webforms And Offline Queue

- Login-gated webforms must not read `app_store` directly or use browser
  secrets.
- Former public forms now use Supabase auth state intentionally for login and
  locked submitter identity.
- Light is allowed only on contained report/form surfaces; weigh-ins, Production,
  and Pasture Map remain outside the Light allowlist.
- Offline queue IndexedDB ownership is centralized in `src/lib/offlineQueue.js`.
- Offline RPC replay goes through `useOfflineRpcSubmit` where needed.
- Ownership stamping is server-side on replay.
- Shared TEST DB Playwright specs that reset/seed the DB must run one file at a
  time.

### Storage And File Inputs

- Upload owner/count guards are intentionally brittle.
- New upload/remove/signed/public URL owners require updating the matching static
  guard.
- Task, daily, and comment attachment uploads are append-only.
- Image file inputs intentionally omit `capture=` so mobile users can choose
  camera or library upload through the native picker.

### Runtime Observability

- `client_error_events` records redacted browser/runtime errors through
  `record_client_error`.
- `/admin/client-errors` is read-only, admin-gated, fail-closed, paginated, and
  uses `list_client_errors`.
- Client error reporting must not store raw localStorage, auth tokens, full
  payloads, or secret-like data.

### Shared UI And Record Chrome

- Global openable affordance is shared through `.hoverable-tile` for card/div
  openables and `.hoverable-row` for table-row openables.
- Do not put `.hoverable-tile` on `<tr>` or `.hoverable-row` on non-`tr`
  elements.
- `RecordPageShell` owns record-page frame/loading/not-found/body/title chrome.
- `RecordCollaborationSection` is the only component that composes
  `CommentsSection` and `RecordActivityLog`.
- `RecordActivityLog` is audit-only and filters `comment.posted`.
- `RecordSequenceNav` is the shared sequence-navigation primitive.
- `app_saved_views` saved views are a generic per-surface primitive.
- `DeleteModal` and `ConfirmModal` are app-level modal primitives.
- CSV export ownership lives in `csvExport.js`; row-print export ownership lives
  in `printExport.js`.
- Record page controls live in `src/shared/recordPageControls.jsx`.

### Source Boundary Guards

Static guards lock these boundaries. If a legitimate new owner is added, update
the guard in the same lane and explain why:

- Supabase client owner.
- Browser secret/env usage.
- `app_store`, `webform_config`, `profiles` access.
- `localStorage` owner/key inventory.
- IndexedDB/offline queue owner.
- Notifications client-write prohibition.
- Task API boundary.
- Comments/Activity table access.
- Route alias ownership.
- Light portal/access boundary.
- Login-gated webforms boundary.
- Storage upload/remove/signed/public URL ownership.
- Append-only bucket upload contracts.
- Image file input capture contract.
- Hard-delete owner inventory.
- Mutation semantics inventory.
- CP2 daily writes via ownership RPCs.
- Delete/recovery classification.
- Legacy Activity retirement.
- Load/retry readiness inventory.
- Shared UI extraction contract.
- Openable hover affordance contract.

Playwright notes:

- Specs that reset the shared TEST DB must run one file at a time.
- Local dev-server cold-start can hang if stray node/vite processes remain in
  old worktrees. Clear stale processes before diagnosing product flake.

## Agent Session Checklist

Before a new lane:

1. Read [HO.md](HO.md).
2. Read Current State, Build Queue, and the relevant contracts here.
3. Run `git status --short`, `git worktree list`, and inspect recent `git log`.
4. Identify dirty-tree risk, active worktrees, open gates, and migration state.
5. Inspect files in scope before planning.
6. If touching a boundary guard, update the guard in the same lane.
7. If touching SQL/RPC/RLS/Storage, state TEST/PROD apply and verification needs
   in the plan.
8. If approving a commit gate, queue the next CC-ready prompt in the same Codex
   response per [HO.md](HO.md).
