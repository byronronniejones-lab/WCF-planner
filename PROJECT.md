# WCF Planner

Farm-management web app for White Creek Farm. React/Vite SPA, Supabase backend,
Netlify production deploy from GitHub `main`.

This file is project-specific truth: current state, active roadmap,
architecture map, and load-bearing contracts. Workflow, gates, and relay format
live in [HO.md](HO.md). Do not turn this file into a session transcript.

## Current State

- Production: `https://wcfplanner.com`
- Deploy: Netlify auto-deploy from `main`
- Production source: `origin/main` via Netlify auto-deploy.
- Latest confirmed shipped checkpoint: `a7557ef feat(cattle): add admin-only
  soft-delete/restore for cattle.animal`.
- Open gates: none.
- PROD migrations live: `057` notifications, `058` activity events,
  `060` mention contract, `062` activity entity expansion, `063`
  notification activity resolution, `064` activity Phase 2 entities, `065`
  global activity log, `066` activity change events, `067` daily soft-delete,
  `068` client error events / durable client error reporting, `069` cattle
  animal soft-delete / restore.
- PROD migrations drafted/stashed only: `059_daily_unique_indexes.sql` is not
  applied. `061_daily_report_soft_delete_restore.sql` is superseded by `067`.
- CI note: verify may be red from known unrelated Playwright flakes. Do not mix
  CI-stabilization work into feature lanes.

### Recent Shipped Work

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Eggmobile 3 fallback | Live. Layer housing count fallback restored Eggmobile 3 and active layer totals. |
| Daily duplicate prevention | Live. Pre-submit duplicate guards are merged; DB unique-index migration `059` remains unapplied. |
| Broiler batch location labels | Live. Broiler daily/report dropdowns show current housing/location labels while storing the plain batch name. |
| Home Weather | Live. Tomorrow.io forecast proxy, 10-day forecast, rain/freeze focus, and animated radar are on Home. |
| Notifications Center | Live. `task_completed` and `mention` notifications use `public.notifications`; task and non-task mention deep-links are live. |
| Activity + @Mentions | Live. Comments, @mentions, compact chips, ActivityModal, and deep-links are live for 10 entity types. |
| Global Activity Log | Live at `/activity`. Permission-filtered RPC reads `activity_events`; comments, task completions, deleted-comment placeholders, and explicit system/change events show there. |
| Activity Layer foundation | Live. `record_activity_event` records allowlisted change/lifecycle events through SECDEF RPC. Layer batch notes and equipment status are pilot surfaces. |
| Entity mutation helper | Live. `runMutation` standardizes client mutation errors plus optional best-effort Activity logging; it is not transactional. |
| Daily soft-delete + restore | Live. Transactional SECDEF RPCs `soft_delete_daily_report` / `restore_daily_report` (admin-only). 6 daily entity types registered. `deleted_at`/`deleted_by` on all 6 daily tables. All read sites filtered. Admin Recently Deleted tab with restore. `record.deleted`/`record.restored` Activity events with human-readable labels. |
| Cattle soft-delete + restore | Live. Admin-only source-row soft-delete/restore for `cattle.animal` through SECDEF RPCs in migration `069`. Normal cattle reads hide deleted rows; admin Recently Deleted can restore; no cattle DELETE policy remains. |
| Daily per-record Activity UI | Live. Compact Activity chips + ActivityModal on all 6 authenticated daily views; entity types already registered; no daily notes/issues/comments replacement. |
| Error Resilience Phase 1 | Live. App-root ErrorBoundary, global `error` and `unhandledrejection` capture, and durable redacted client error events through `record_client_error` SECDEF RPC / `client_error_events` table. |
| Activity change logging | Live. Routine field edits on `cattle.animal`, `sheep.animal`, and `equipment.item` now record `field.updated`/`status.changed` Activity events through the existing Activity Layer. Cattle delete/restore is now transactional/audited; sheep delete/restore, lifecycle/move actions, equipment child records, and admin-only documents remain deferred. |
| Stash hygiene | Complete. Three superseded WIP stashes were audited and dropped; `git stash list` verified empty and `main` matched `origin/main`. |
| Hamburger cleanup | Live. Hamburger has Home, Activity, Webforms: Dailys/Equipment, Admin/Users, Sign Out. |
| Home farrow window wording | Live. Misleading `N pending` text removed from Home Next 30 Days farrowing windows. |
| Tasks v2 | Canonical at `/tasks`; old `/my-tasks` and `/admin/tasks` are aliases. |

### Parked WIP Stash

Stash numbers can change if new stashes are added; always verify with
`git stash list` before acting. Do not pop or drop blindly.

No parked WIP stashes are expected as of 2026-05-24. The prior three
superseded stashes were audited and dropped during stash hygiene.

---

## Active Roadmap

1. Sheep delete/restore strategy design - decide source-row soft-delete vs
   tombstone/resolver model before implementation.
2. Audit-grade SECDEF RPCs - cattle/sheep lifecycle/status/move actions where
   mutation + Activity must be atomic.
3. Critical workflow Playwright matrix - define coverage targets, write specs
   for highest-risk uncovered paths.
4. Incremental mutation cleanup - domain by domain per Identity Map. Choose
   direct / `runMutation` / SECDEF per entity risk.
5. Shared UI extraction - extract filter bar, tile row, loading/empty/error
   patterns from views that repeat them 3+ times.
6. Deferred: code-splitting - only when field-device measurements or
   operator pain justify it.
7. Deferred: TypeScript - gradual `allowJs` + JSDoc approach if/when
   started.

---

## Platform Roadmap

Longer-term direction organized by capability tier. Active Roadmap items
above are the near-term build queue drawn from these tiers.

### Record Identity and Audit Coverage

Every meaningful entity needs a stable ID, human label, route/deep-link,
permission resolver, Activity/comments status, mutation path, and audit
status. The Record Identity Map below is the planning anchor. Expand it as
new entities gain Activity, mutation helpers, or delete/restore support.

### Error Resilience and Runtime Signals

Phase 1 shipped. App-root ErrorBoundary catches render/lifecycle crashes.
Global `error` and `unhandledrejection` listeners capture async/event
failures. Redacted client error events persist durably through
`record_client_error` SECDEF RPC and `client_error_events` table (migration
068). Feature-level error handling also remains (Header badges soft-fail,
RPC callers catch, offline queue classifies errors). Admin dashboard,
alerting, trend views, and external monitoring services are later tiers.

### Mutation Semantics

~200 direct `sb.from()` mutation calls exist across `src/`. Direct calls are
not automatically wrong — the missing piece is per-entity write semantics.
`runMutation` fits routine saves that want optional Activity logging. SECDEF
RPCs fit audit-critical flows where mutation and Activity must succeed or
fail together. `runMutation` caller count is not a success metric; correct
write path per entity is.

### Delete/Restore and Recovery Strategy

Daily reports and `cattle.animal` prove source-row soft-delete without
tombstones: the source row remains with `deleted_at`, and the Activity resolver
sees deleted rows. Remaining domains need deliberate design: sheep hard-delete
orphans children, and equipment/task sub-records still need per-entity recovery
decisions. Tombstones are only needed where source rows cannot remain
resolver-visible after deletion.

### Test Coverage Matrix

139 test files (32 unit, 56 static, 50 Playwright, 1 setup) is strong for
~105k lines. Coverage is weighted toward tasks, activity, and cattle
soft-delete. Broader cattle CRUD, equipment lifecycle, and weigh-in flows have
thinner E2E coverage. The
matrix should define which workflows must always have Playwright coverage
and fill gaps incrementally.

### Shared UI Extraction

14 shared components exist in `src/shared/`. The path is extraction from
proven patterns, not top-down design. When a pattern repeats across 3+
views (filter bar, date-grouped tile list, chip row, loading/empty/error
states), extract it.

### Deferred Long-Term Maturity

- TypeScript: 105k lines of pure JS. Gradual `allowJs` + JSDoc + typed
  utility modules when started, not a repo-wide conversion.
- Code-splitting: current 2 MB main chunk loads once and is browser-cached.
  Dynamic `import()` already defers xlsx and pdfjs-dist. Route-level
  splitting is justified only when field-device measurements show a problem.

---

## Record Identity Map

Compact reference for per-entity platform decisions. Default permission
model is RLS for table-backed entities and `program_access` checks for
`app_store` entities. Expand this table as new entities gain Activity,
mutation helpers, or delete/restore support.

### Primary Entities — Activity Wired

| Entity | Stable ID | Label | Storage | Mutation | Delete | Audit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| task.instance | text | title | `task_instances` | SECDEF RPCs | hard (RPC, validated) | comments + task.completed trigger |
| poultry.daily | UUID | date + batch_label | `poultry_dailys` | direct | soft (SECDEF) | comments + deleted/restored events |
| layer.daily | UUID | date + batch_label | `layer_dailys` | direct | soft (SECDEF) | comments + deleted/restored events |
| egg.daily | UUID | date | `egg_dailys` | direct | soft (SECDEF) | comments + deleted/restored events |
| pig.daily | UUID | date + batch_label | `pig_dailys` | direct | soft (SECDEF) | comments + deleted/restored events |
| cattle.daily | UUID | date + herd | `cattle_dailys` | direct | soft (SECDEF) | comments + deleted/restored events |
| sheep.daily | UUID | date + flock | `sheep_dailys` | direct | soft (SECDEF) | comments + deleted/restored events |
| broiler.batch | name (string) | batch name | `app_store` ppp-v4 | direct (upsert) | TBD | partial — delete unlogged |
| pig.batch | group id | batchName | `app_store` ppp-feeders-v1 | direct (upsert) | TBD | partial |
| layer.batch | UUID | name | `layer_batches` | direct | hard-cascade (housings) | partial |
| layer.housing | UUID | housing_name | `layer_housings` | direct | hard (via batch cascade) | partial |
| cattle.animal | UUID | tag | `cattle` | direct + `runMutation` + SECDEF delete/restore | soft (SECDEF, admin-only) | comments + routine field.updated + deleted/restored events |
| sheep.animal | UUID | tag | `sheep` | direct + `runMutation` | hard-orphan (children remain) | comments + routine field.updated; delete unlogged |
| cattle.processing | UUID | batch name | `cattle_processing_batches` | direct | hard (scheduled only) | partial |
| sheep.processing | UUID | batch name | `sheep_processing_batches` | direct | hard | partial |
| equipment.item | UUID | name | `equipment` | mixed — status + admin fields via `runMutation`, inline detail fields direct | record itself not deletable; child fuelings/maintenance hard-delete | comments + routine field.updated + status.changed; documents/child records excluded |

### Sub-Entities — No Activity Wiring

| Entity | Storage | Parent | Delete | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| weigh_in_sessions | `weigh_in_sessions` | cattle/pig/sheep | hard | SECDEF batch submit for creation |
| weigh_ins | `weigh_ins` | session | hard | child entries |
| cattle_comments | `cattle_comments` | cattle.animal | survives cattle soft-delete | Hard-cascade only if forbidden parent hard-delete bypasses RLS. |
| cattle_transfers | `cattle_transfers` | cattle.animal | survives cattle soft-delete | Parent hard-delete is blocked; transfer trail remains. |
| cattle_calving_records | `cattle_calving_records` | cattle.animal | survives cattle soft-delete | `calf_id` remains on soft-delete; `dam_tag` is text. |
| sheep_comments | `sheep_comments` | sheep.animal | hard (does not cascade) | |
| cattle_breeding_cycles | `cattle_breeding_cycles` | cattle.animal | hard | |
| sheep_lambing_records | `sheep_lambing_records` | sheep.animal | hard (does not cascade) | |
| equipment_fuelings | `equipment_fuelings` | equipment.item | hard | current-reading recompute on delete |
| equipment_maintenance_events | `equipment_maintenance_events` | equipment.item | hard | |
| fuel_bills | `fuel_bills` | admin | TBD | |
| fuel_supplies | `fuel_supplies` | admin | TBD | |

### app_store JSON — No Stable Per-Record ID

| Key | Domain | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ppp-v4` | broiler batches | `batch.name` is display ID; no UUID per record |
| `ppp-feeders-v1` | pig feeder groups + sub-batches | group-level ID exists; sub-batch IDs are client-generated |
| `ppp-pigs-v1` | pig herd data | no per-record stable ID |
| `ppp-breeding-v1` | pig breeding cycles | no per-record stable ID |
| `ppp-farrowing-v1` | pig farrowing records | no per-record stable ID |
| `ppp-breeders-v1` | pig breeders | no per-record stable ID |
| `ppp-feed-orders-v1` | feed orders | no per-record stable ID |
| `ppp-pig-feed-inventory-v1` | pig feed inventory | no per-record stable ID |
| `ppp-poultry-feed-inventory-v1` | poultry feed inventory | no per-record stable ID |

Entities without stable per-record IDs cannot participate in Activity,
deep-links, or per-record audit trails until identity decisions are made.

---

## Known Platform Risks

These are hardening priorities, not reasons to rewrite.

- Hard-delete data loss and audit blindness. Daily reports and `cattle.animal`
  now use soft-delete/restore with Activity events. Routine field edits on
  cattle/sheep/equipment log Activity events, but sheep delete/restore,
  livestock lifecycle/move actions, equipment sub-records, weigh-in sessions,
  breeding/lambing records, and task templates still need recovery and audit
  decisions. Sheep hard-delete orphans children. See the Record Identity Map
  for per-entity delete behavior.
- Direct client mutations are the dominant write pattern (~200 call sites in
  `src`). Direct calls are not automatically wrong; the missing piece is
  per-entity write semantics specifying which paths should be direct,
  `runMutation`, or SECDEF RPC. The Record Identity Map tracks this.
- Runtime observability is Phase 1 only. Redacted client error events now
  persist through migration 068, but there is no admin UI, alerting, trend
  view, or third-party monitoring. Keep future logging changes redacted and
  minimal.
- `runMutation` is non-transactional. If a client mutation succeeds and its
  Activity RPC fails, the data change is already committed. Audit-critical
  paths need transactional SECDEF RPCs/triggers.
- `app_store` JSON entities need stable per-record IDs before they can
  participate in Activity, deep-links, and per-record audit trails.
- Playwright coverage is weighted toward tasks, activity, and cattle
  soft-delete. Broader cattle CRUD, equipment lifecycle, and weigh-in flows
  have thinner E2E coverage.
- `059_daily_unique_indexes.sql` remains unapplied. Do not apply until
  duplicate cleanup is explicitly approved and a safe `egg_dailys` scope is
  designed.
- Current main JS chunk is ~2 MB. Dynamic `import()` already defers xlsx
  and pdfjs-dist. Route-level code-splitting is deferred unless
  field-device measurements or operator pain justify it.

---

## Locked Decisions

- No Home Dashboard duplicate-report card.
- No routine duplicate-report notification fanout.
- Future duplicate handling should prevent the duplicate before save where
  possible, then use DB constraints where the scope is valid.
- `egg_dailys` gets warning/pre-submit guard only. Its current data does not
  support a safe hard unique scope.
- Deleted records need global visibility because the original tile may no
  longer exist. Per-tile activity is not enough.
- Activity is Podio-style per entity/tile; a separate global audit/recently
  deleted surface is needed for deletes.
- Delete events may belong in Notifications Center because they are operational
  exceptions, not routine duplicate noise.
- Activity Log is accessible to all authenticated users and is permission
  filtered server-side. It is not admin-only.
- Activity comments are separate from existing record data fields such as
  notes, issues, comments/concerns, session notes, and operator notes. Do not
  replace those fields with Activity comments.
- Activity Layer change/lifecycle events go through `record_activity_event`,
  use `_activity_can_write`, and avoid notification fanout unless explicitly
  requested.
- `record.deleted` and `record.restored` currently mean soft-delete /
  tombstone-preserved records only. Hard-deleted entity visibility needs a
  separate tombstone/deleted-record resolver design.
- Phase 1 Activity event logging is UI-level best-effort unless a lane builds a
  transactional server RPC/trigger that mutates data and records Activity in the
  same transaction.
- Future feature lanes should identify the record/entity being changed, whether
  it needs per-record Activity/comments, how meaningful changes are logged, and
  which Playwright path proves the user workflow.
- Platform hardening should favor shared contracts that let the app grow toward
  300k+ lines without repeated per-surface invention.
- CC should not repitch skipped skill installs: UI UX Pro Max, Impeccable/Taste
  for WCF, Stop Slop, GSD, claude-mem for WCF, OpenSpec.
- `runMutation` caller count is not a success metric. The goal is correct
  write semantics per entity: direct calls for simple saves, `runMutation`
  for routine mutations that want optional Activity logging, SECDEF RPCs for
  audit-critical flows.
- Soft-delete does not require tombstones when the source row remains
  resolver-visible via `deleted_at`. Daily reports prove this model.
- Cattle soft-delete uses the source `cattle` row with `deleted_at` /
  `deleted_by`, not tombstones. Sold/deceased/processed are business states,
  not delete states. Active-herd cattle tag uniqueness remains scoped to
  `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, and `bulls`, and excludes deleted
  rows.
- Tombstones are needed only for true hard-deleted records where source rows
  cannot remain resolver-visible and audit visibility is still required.

## Platform Lane Checklist

Use this checklist when planning any lane that creates, edits, deletes,
restores, completes, reopens, moves, or comments on planner records.

- Name the record/entity being changed, its stable ID, label, route, storage
  source, and permission resolver.
- Decide whether the record needs a separate Activity/comments timeline.
- Keep Activity comments separate from existing notes/issues/comments-concerns
  fields.
- Use `runMutation` for routine client-side mutation consistency when it fits,
  but do not treat it as transactional.
- Use a SECDEF RPC/trigger when the data mutation and Activity event must be
  atomic.
- Log meaningful saved user actions; do not log keystrokes or noisy autosave
  ticks.
- Identify the focused Playwright path that proves the user workflow when a
  lane changes mutation behavior or adds a new surface.
- Identify delete behavior and restore expectations before modifying delete
  paths. Consult the Record Identity Map for current per-entity state.
- Identify whether the lane introduces a new unhandled runtime failure mode
  or needs error reporting coverage.
- Choose direct write vs `runMutation` vs SECDEF RPC based on entity risk
  and the Record Identity Map, not helper adoption targets.
- State commit, push, PROD migration, deploy, and docs gates separately.

## Load-Bearing Contracts

Read the relevant contract before editing its files.

### Cross-App

- Do not change Supabase auth config in `src/lib/supabase.js` without a plan.
- Keep `wcfSelectAll`; Supabase `.limit()` silently caps at 1000.
- Keep BrowserRouter view-to-URL adapter unless doing a planned router lane.
- Do not introduce `window.confirm`, `window.alert`, or `window.prompt`.
- Use inline notices, `DeleteModal`, or typed confirmation surfaces.
- Public forms must keep no-auth access where documented.
- Netlify redirect order matters: `equipment.html` rules before SPA fallback.
- No migrations, RLS, Vault, Edge Function deploys, or production data actions
  without Ronnie's explicit gate from [HO.md](HO.md).

### Supabase And Storage

- Never delete directly from `storage.objects`; use Storage API list/remove
  recursion.
- Private buckets are read through signed URLs.
- Task photo uploads are append-only (`upsert:false`); duplicate object errors
  are retry success.
- Admin-created user emails, welcome emails, and password resets are sent by
  `rapid-processor` from `noreply@wcfplanner.com`.
- PROD `exec_sql` is forbidden.

### Tasks

- `/tasks` is canonical.
- Task writes go through v2 wrappers/RPCs only.
- Do not directly update `task_instances` or task sidecar tables from UI code.
- Do not call `generate_system_task_instance` from frontend code.
- `task_instance_photos` is canonical; legacy single-path columns are fallback
  display only.
- Header task badge soft-fails to zero and must not break Header rendering.
- Task assignee dropdowns use `loadTaskAssignableProfilesById` and fail closed
  on config read errors.

### Notifications

- Client cannot insert/delete notifications.
- Notification writes happen inside SECURITY DEFINER paths.
- Recipient-only RLS: users can select/update only their own rows.
- Recipient UPDATE grant is column-scoped to `read_at`.
- `complete_task_instance` notification insert must never roll back the task
  completion.
- Skip task-completed notification when creator is null or completer is creator.
- Valid `notifications.type`: `task_completed`, `mention`. New types require a
  migration that widens the CHECK.
- Header bell soft-fails to zero and must not break Header rendering.

### Activity And Mentions

- All activity reads/writes go through SECURITY DEFINER RPCs:
  `list_activity_events`, `count_activity_for_entity`,
  `post_activity_comment`, `edit_activity_event`, `delete_activity_event`,
  `list_global_activity`, `record_activity_event`.
- No direct `.from('activity_events')` or `.from('activity_mentions')` in
  `src`.
- `_activity_can_read(entity_type, entity_id)` is fail-closed. Entity existence
  is checked before role shortcuts; admin does not bypass fake-id rejection.
- Supported entity types are: `task.instance`, `broiler.batch`, `pig.batch`,
  `layer.batch`, `layer.housing`, `cattle.animal`, `cattle.processing`,
  `sheep.animal`, `sheep.processing`, `equipment.item`, `poultry.daily`,
  `layer.daily`, `egg.daily`, `pig.daily`, `cattle.daily`, `sheep.daily`.
- New entity type = one `_activity_can_read` resolver branch, one
  `activityRegistry` entry, route/deep-link mapping, one surface wire-up, and a
  mutation/error/activity plan that uses `runMutation` or a SECDEF RPC where
  appropriate.
- `/activity` is a permission-filtered global timeline backed by
  `list_global_activity`; it must never bypass `_activity_can_read`.
- `record_activity_event` event types are server-allowlisted:
  `field.updated`, `status.changed`, `record.created`, `record.deleted`,
  `record.restored`. New event types require a migration.
- `record.deleted` and `record.restored` require the source entity to still
  exist for `_activity_can_read` / `_activity_can_write`; hard-delete audit
  visibility needs a tombstone/deleted-record design.
- Meaningful change logging must avoid keystroke/autosave noise. Prefer saved
  user actions such as notes/status/date/location/count changes.
- Pilot Activity change logging writes data first and records Activity
  best-effort. Security-critical or audit-critical paths should move toward
  server RPCs/triggers that mutate data and insert Activity in one transaction.
- Activity comments are a timeline/conversation layer, not a replacement for
  record data fields like daily comments/concerns or notes.
- Mentions use `p_mentions[]` as identity. Visible body stays user-friendly
  plain `@Name`; UUIDs must not appear in body text.
- Server validates mentions: profile exists, profile active, max 10 mentions,
  caller can write. Self-mention records the mention but sends no notification.
- `delete_activity_event` is soft-delete only; author or admin.
- If a SECDEF RPC return shape changes, migration must end with
  `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`.

### Entity Mutations

- `runMutation` in `src/lib/entityMutations.js` is the shared helper for
  routine client-side mutation consistency: run mutation, check error, optionally
  record Activity after success, and return `{ok, data}` or `{ok, error}`.
- `runMutation` must stay small. It must not know table names, business rules,
  entity-specific permissions, or UI components.
- `mutateFn` must return a Supabase-style `{data, error}` object. Undefined,
  null, or non-object returns are caller bugs and should fail.
- `runMutation` must never record Activity when the mutation failed.
- `runMutation` is not transactional. If the mutation succeeds and Activity
  logging fails, the data change is already committed.
- Use server-side SECDEF RPCs/triggers for audit-critical flows where mutation
  and Activity must succeed or fail together, especially delete/restore and
  lifecycle/status transitions.
- New routine save paths should prefer `runMutation` when it fits, while keeping
  domain logic in the caller.

### Daily Reports

- Add Feed quick-log rows can share daily tables but are not a substitute for a
  full daily report. Missed-report checks exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Duplicate prevention target:
  - poultry/pig/layer: `(date, batch_label)`
  - cattle: `(date, herd)`
  - sheep: `(date, flock)`
  - partial indexes exclude Add Feed rows
  - `egg_dailys`: warning/pre-submit guard only, no hard unique index yet
- Existing PROD duplicate cleanup is required before applying migration `059`.
- Daily reports use soft-delete via `soft_delete_daily_report` /
  `restore_daily_report` SECDEF RPCs (admin-only, transactional with Activity).
  All daily table reads filter `.is('deleted_at', null)`. Admin Recently Deleted
  tab shows deleted reports with restore. No hard-delete path remains for dailys.
- Delete button is admin-only across all 6 daily views.
- `dailyDuplicateCheck.js` excludes soft-deleted records from duplicate checks.

### Pig

- Feeder group started counts are authoritative.
- Current count is ledger-derived, not persisted `currentCount`.
- Planned-trip row shape stays exactly:
  `{id, date, sex, subBatchId, plannedCount, order}`.
- Lock state lives only in `ppp-pig-planned-trip-locks-v1`.
- `processingTrips[].subAttributions` must be stamped as
  `{subId, subBatchName, sex, count}`.
- Send-to-Trip from `/pig/weighins` may reconcile a locked planned trip count,
  but cannot change the locked date.
- Use `pigSlug` for sub-batch matching.

### Broiler And Layers

- Broiler batches live in `ppp-v4`.
- Public `/weighins` cannot read or mutate `app_store.ppp-v4` directly.
- Public week 4/6 completion uses `stamp_broiler_batch_avg` RPC.
- Do not grant anon direct `app_store` access.
- Admin weigh-in paths may use authenticated `app_store` helpers.
- Layer `current_count` is physical anchor; projected count subtracts
  mortalities since anchor.

### Feed Planning

- Feed math lives in `src/lib/feedPlanner.js`; views should not rebuild it.
- `LEAD_TIME_DAYS = 7`, `RESERVE_DAYS.default = 30`,
  `ORDER_ROUNDING_LBS = 50`, `STALE_SNAPSHOT_DAYS = 21`.
- Feed types: `pig`, `starter`, `grower`, `layerfeed`.
- Snapshot counts are anchors; today's on-hand subtracts consumption since the
  snapshot date.
- Poultry burn uses existing broiler/layer schedule helpers.

### Cattle And Sheep

- Cattle and sheep use dedicated Supabase tables, not `app_store`.
- Cattle herds: `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, `bulls`.
- Sheep flocks: `rams`, `ewes`, `feeders`.
- Cattle animal delete/restore is admin-only through
  `soft_delete_cattle_animal` / `restore_cattle_animal`; clients have no direct
  cattle DELETE policy.
- Normal cattle read surfaces filter `deleted_at IS NULL`. Admin Recently
  Deleted surfaces may read deleted cattle through admin-gated RLS.
- Cattle active-herd tag uniqueness is `tag` where `deleted_at IS NULL` and
  herd is one of `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, `bulls`.
- Sold/deceased/processed cattle are not delete states; they remain active
  records for delete/restore purposes.
- Processing batch detail may resolve a deleted cow by ID in admin context; do
  not add a `deleted_at` filter to `src/lib/cattleProcessingBatch.js` unless
  that workflow is redesigned.
- Cattle processing storage statuses remain `scheduled`, `active`, `complete`;
  UI may label `complete` as Processed.
- Cattle move only when Send-to-Processor promotes a row to `active`.
- `loadCattleWeighInsCached` keeps the two-query pattern. Do not rewrite to
  `!inner`.
- Old cattle tag source strings are load-bearing: `import`, `weigh_in`,
  `manual`.

### Cattle And Sheep Inputs

- Admin panel: `src/admin/LivestockFeedInputsPanel.jsx`.
- Public/new-record dropdowns hide only `status === 'inactive'`; legacy
  blank/null status remains selectable.
- Daily edit/history surfaces must load inactive referenced inputs for snapshot
  rebuilding; filter inactive rows at dropdown render sites, not load time.

### Equipment

- Logged-in Equipment: `/fleet`.
- Public equipment/fueling: `/equipment` and `/equipment/<slug>`.
- Public fueling uses `submit_equipment_fueling` RPC.
- Fuel-log edit/delete paths recompute current readings from remaining fuel logs.
- Equipment checklist/material textboxes must not reload, lose focus, or reorder
  list items on click/edit.
- Rolling materials clears are bucketed by due service cycle.

### Icons

- Use `public/icons/planner` through `PlannerIcon` or `plannerIconUrl`.
- App code must not reference `C:\Users\Ronni\OneDrive\Desktop\planner pics`.
- Do not put images inside `<option>` elements; use text fallback there.
