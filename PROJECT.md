# WCF Planner

Farm-management web app for White Creek Farm. React/Vite single-page app,
Supabase backend, Netlify production deploy from GitHub `main`.

This file is the durable project map: current state, architecture, roadmap, and
load-bearing contracts. Workflow, roles, gates, and relay format live in
[HO.md](HO.md). Do not turn this file into a session transcript.

Last updated: 2026-06-06.
Current production checkpoint: latest app/build commit `ad47fee` on `main`
(processing-attach RPC lane + daily edit-page locked team-member fields).
Production URL: https://wcfplanner.com.

---

## Start Here

1. Read [HO.md](HO.md) for workflow and gates.
2. Read this file's Current State, Build Queue, and the relevant contracts.
3. Run `git status --short` and inspect recent `git log` before planning or
   editing.
4. Inspect the files in scope before changing anything.

Default session model: Codex plans/reviews, CC builds/validates, Ronnie approves
commit/push/PROD gates. Codex may build or edit only when Ronnie assigns it.

This file should answer "what is true now?" at the start of a session. Use git
history and tests for detailed lane history.

## Project Map Governance

This file is a docs-as-code project map, not a session log, scratchpad, or
append-only changelog. It uses project-specific rules first, with these external
references as guard rails:

- Diataxis documentation structure: separate reference, explanation, how-to, and
  tutorial content. `PROJECT.md` is durable reference plus brief explanation;
  procedural workflow belongs in `HO.md`, and detailed history belongs in git or
  `archive/SESSION_LOG.md`. Reference: https://diataxis.fr/.
- RFC 2119 / RFC 8174 requirement language: capitalized `MUST`, `MUST NOT`,
  `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, and `MAY` carry normative force. Use them only for
  rules future agents must preserve. References:
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2119/ and
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8174/.
- Google developer documentation style: project-specific style comes first, then
  a general developer-doc style guide for clarity and consistency. Reference:
  https://developers.google.com/style/.
- Google documentation best practices: keep docs minimal and accurate, update
  docs with code, delete dead documentation, and avoid duplication. Reference:
  https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/best_practices.html.

Rules for editing this file:

- Build Queue is the only home for outstanding build/design work. Do not hide
  "future", "needs", "still needs", "TODO", or "TBD" work in later sections.
- Contract sections describe current architecture, standards, and guard rails.
  If a contract is aspirational rather than true, move the work to Build Queue
  and state the current guard/inventory honestly.
- Current State and Latest Shipped Checkpoint summarize what is live now.
  Detailed lane narrative belongs in git history or the archive, not here.
- Inventory counts, migration state, test names, and owner lists must match the
  source/static guards at the time of edit. Prefer pointing to the guard as the
  source of truth instead of duplicating fragile counts here.
- Every Build Queue item should state class (`DEFECT`, `DECISION`, `ENH`),
  scope, success criteria, validation/guard target, and any migration/PROD gate
  once it is promoted into an active lane.
- Remove or reconcile stale text instead of appending corrections nearby. The
  file should read as one coherent project map written intentionally.
- Normal build/hotfix lanes must not edit this file unless Ronnie explicitly
  requests docs, wrap, or a named `PROJECT.md` change.

- Design/function invariants that govern cross-surface behavior now live in
  `## Global Decisions (Constitution)` and `## Design System`.

## Global Decisions (Constitution)

The following decisions are locked and govern future builds. New code and surface
changes MUST conform unless this section is amended.

Rules (normative):
- Global Decisions are loaded from this section and enforced with lane guard
  targets.
- No surface may silently diverge from a locked decision. New exceptions MUST be
  added to `## Intentional Non-Uniformities` with justification.
- Changing any locked decision requires a Ronnie-approved amendment in this file
  and the relevant guard target in the same change.
- This lock covers the decisions and functional invariants in this section plus
  the entire `## Design System` section. The rest of `PROJECT.md` (Current State,
  Build Queue, inventories, contract narrative) updates normally under
  `## Project Map Governance`.
- The entire `## Design System` section is a Global Decision: its tokens, palette,
  elevation, z-index ladder, canonical components, and iconography policy MUST NOT
  change except by amendment.
- Agents MAY propose amendments with rationale and evidence; Ronnie ratifies.

| Decision | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Font scale | Locked | `tests/static/typography_tokens_static.test.js` |
| 2 Button corners | Locked | `tests/static/border_radius_scale_static.test.js` |
| 3 Confirm/Delete stacking | Locked | `tests/static/zindex_scale_static.test.js` |
| 4 Button height/padding | Locked | `tests/static/button_control_tokens_static.test.js` |
| 5 Save model (Submit vs autosave) | Ratified; enforcement pending | Lane D save/autosave guard (static + Playwright) |

1. Font sizes use a clean px scale. Canonical set: `10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18,
   20, 22, 26`. Lift `9 -> 10`, fold `17 -> 18`, `24 -> 22`, `28 -> 26`.
   Display whitelist remains `32/34/36/48/56` for hero-only usage. Fractional
   font values (`12.5`, `10.5`) are forbidden.
   - Guard target: `tests/static/typography_tokens_static.test.js` (hard clamp to
     this set).

2. Button corners use canonical `6px` radius. The values `7` and `8` are retired.
   Canonical radius set is `{4, 6, 10, 14, 999, '50%'}`.
   - Guard target: `tests/static/border_radius_scale_static.test.js`.

3. Confirm/Delete dialogs remain top-tier destructive overlay priority at
   toast (`9000`) so confirm stacks are never visually hidden.
   - Guard target: `tests/static/zindex_scale_static.test.js`.

4. Button vertical pad defaults to `10px`; the standard button pad is `10px 16px`.
   - Guard target: `tests/static/button_control_tokens_static.test.js`.

5. Save model is contractually split by surface:
   - Submit-style surfaces (daily reports, webforms, modals) use explicit Save/
     Submit controls.
   - Edit-in-place surfaces (record pages, weigh-in entry) use autosave.
   - Guard target: Lane D save/autosave coverage and Playwright.

### Locked functional invariants

These load-bearing behaviors are Global Decisions, defined in full in the
referenced contract sections. This table designates them amendment-locked: new or
changed code MUST conform, and changing one requires a Ronnie-approved amendment
plus a guard update in the same change.

| Invariant | Contract section | Guard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single Supabase client owner; no unapproved browser secrets | Cross-App Rules | `supabase_client_owner_static.test.js`, `browser_secret_boundary_static.test.js` |
| Permissions enforced by RLS/RPC, never UI alone | Authentication And Roles | `light_user_portal_static.test.js` |
| Route aliases only in `src/lib/routes.js` | Route Ownership | `url_alias_redirects.spec.js` |
| Fail-closed loading order (record + list) | Cold-Boot And Fail-Closed Loading | `load_retry_robustness_inventory_static.test.js` |
| Audit-critical mutations via SECDEF RPC; no client writes to activity, comments, or notifications | Entity Mutations And Audit Atomicity; Activity, Comments, Mentions, Notifications | `mutation_semantics_inventory_static.test.js` |
| Daily edits/deletes via ownership RPCs; soft-delete protected roots | Daily Reports; Delete, Restore, And Recovery | `cp2_daily_writes_via_rpc_static.test.js` |
| One canonical component per UI role | Shared UI And Record Chrome; Design System | `shared_ui_extraction_contract_static.test.js` |

## Current State

- Production deploy: Netlify auto-deploys from GitHub `main`.
- Source of truth: `origin/main`; production app/build checkpoint is commit
  `ad47fee` (2026-06-06 processing-attach RPC lane + daily edit-page locked
  team-member fields). Deploy verified by Netlify bundle-hash rotation.
- Open gates for the shipped tree: none.
- PROD-applied numbered migration series is live through `096`. Migration `082`
  is unused; migration `083` is shelved. Operational note: the daily duplicate
  cleanup `085` was applied before unique-index migration `084`.
- Migration `096` (`processing_attach_activity_rpcs`) was applied to TEST with
  `exec_sql`, then PROD with `psql --single-transaction` and `ON_ERROR_STOP=1`,
  and verified on 2026-06-06: cattle/sheep attach RPCs exist, authenticated has
  EXECUTE, anon is revoked, and PostgREST cache reload was verified by anon REST
  permission denial.
- Migration `095` (`app_saved_views`, generic per-surface saved views) was
  applied to TEST then PROD and verified on 2026-06-05: table + RLS
  (public-or-owner SELECT, owner-only INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE), the owner-stamp
  (`auth.uid()`) and updated_at/owner-freeze triggers, and grants to
  `authenticated`.
- TEST/PROD migrations `074` through `081` plus `084`/`085`/`086` were applied
  and verified during the 2026-06-03 hardening sequence.
- Light-user portal migrations `087`–`092` (CP1+CP2 ownership) were applied to
  PROD atomically (single transaction) and verified on 2026-06-04: `light` role
  in the profiles constraint, `owner_profile_id` on all 9 report tables, the
  server-trusted INSERT stamp + UPDATE owner-freeze triggers, the ownership RPCs,
  and the `092` red-switch (direct UPDATE/DELETE revoked on the 6 daily tables;
  privileged-only RLS on `equipment_fuelings`/`fuel_supplies`).
- Local note for new agents: edit `PROJECT.md` only during explicit docs or wrap
  work. Normal build lanes should leave docs alone.

### Latest Shipped Checkpoint

The following work is merged to `main` and PROD-ready or PROD-applied where
listed:

Earlier load-bearing migrations (`057`–`079`) are summarized under Supabase
Migrations below and in git history; this list keeps the most recent shipped
work:

- Processing-attach RPC lane + daily edit-page locks, migration `096`, PROD
  (2026-06-06, merge `ad47fee`). Authenticated cattle/sheep
  Send-to-Processor attach flows now use transactional SECDEF RPCs for batch
  detail, animal state, transfer audit rows, weigh-in stamps, and Activity.
  Public/shared modal callers keep the legacy helper fallback. The six daily
  edit pages now lock the Team Member field to the signed-in user using the
  shared locked-field control.
- Five-lane ship, code-only except migration `095`, PROD (2026-06-05, merge
  `97da649`). Landed together and deploy-verified:
  - Cattle herd filters / row parity / saved views (migration `095`). Removed the
    local plain-English/Parse smart filter; organized always-visible filter
    groups (Core, Calving/Breeding, Lineage/Other — no Exceptions group);
    `Unmatched Calves` is a checkbox off to the right of Lineage/Other;
    non-calving is a single "No calf since" date control; flat + grouped rows
    share one `CowListRow` (calf count + last-calved parity); saved views via
    `app_saved_views` + `src/lib/savedViewsApi.js` (private/public, owner-only
    edit/delete, RLS-scoped).
  - Cattle/sheep/pig weigh-in entry debounce autosave + Days-since and signed
    +/- weight-delta chips. Per-row Save/Revert removed; edits autosave (700ms),
    on blur, and are flushed before completing a session. Pig autosaves only
    weight/note and keeps sent-to-trip / transferred rows locked.
  - Fixed record-page prev/next navigation: `RecordSequenceNav` pins Prev to the
    left screen edge and Next to the right (vertically centered, broiler
    side-nav placement), as sleek flat pills with neighbor titles + a small
    bottom-center "i of n" pill; stays available while scrolling. Broiler batch
    joined the shared nav and its custom `BatchForm` side-nav was removed.
    (Placement settled via the `22799f1` hotfix after a bottom-center version
    read as hidden.)
  - Broiler auto-processing: active batches auto-advance to `processed` on/after
    `processingDate` (inclusive) via `shouldAutoProcessBroilerBatch`, persisted in
    `loadAllData`.
  - Equipment caught-up home notices (maintenance + materials) and shared home
    alert builders in `src/dashboard/homeAlerts.js`; the Light home now shows
    read-only Missed Daily Reports, Equipment Attention, and Next 30 Days
    (equipment attention routes to `/equipment/<slug>`, never `/fleet`).
- Audited RPC follow-ups, migration `094`, PROD (2026-06-04, commit
  `235647c`). Cattle breeding cycle save/delete and sheep lambing record delete
  now route through authenticated SECDEF RPCs with `search_path = public`,
  PostgREST grants/reload, and transactional Activity writes. Client code no
  longer performs direct writes for those flows.
- Task weekly email correction, migration `093`, PROD (2026-06-04, commit
  `c0b3fed`). `tasks-summary-weekly` now runs Sunday 8am America/Chicago with
  dual UTC cron entries and helper-side DST gating. The weekly window starts at
  the previous Sunday 8am Central. Completed-assigned coverage comes from
  `task_completed` notifications owed to task creators/assignors; recipients
  are open assignees union completed-assigned recipients, assigned-only
  recipients still receive email, and both-empty recipients are skipped.

- Authenticated Light-user portal, CP1+CP2, migrations `087`–`092`, PROD
  (2026-06-04, commit `4b69510` + merge `7de1758`). CP1: real authenticated
  `light` role; the former public report/form URLs (daily, Add Feed, equipment
  fueling, fuel supply, weigh-in) are now login-required with preserved
  URLs/aliases and return-to-URL after login; submitter is locked to the
  signed-in user; Light users are contained to a portal (daily list/record
  views, Add Feed, equipment fueling checklist, Tasks, My Submissions) and
  everything else fails closed. CP2: Light reads ALL reports but edits/deletes
  only its OWN, server-enforced — `owner_profile_id` stamped from `auth.uid()`
  by a BEFORE INSERT trigger (never client-supplied; NULL = legacy/unowned =
  read-only for Light), all daily edits/deletes routed through SECURITY DEFINER
  ownership RPCs with positive per-table column allowlists and server-side
  `field.updated` Activity diffs, and the `092` red-switch revoking direct
  PostgREST UPDATE/DELETE so enforcement is server-side, not UI-only.
- Feed second-tile current-month pin, code-only, PROD. The second feed summary
  tile (pig + broiler) stays on the current calendar month estimate via
  `estTileYM` and no longer rolls forward when a feed order advances the order
  workflow `activeYM`.
- Pig planned-trip weight forecast audit + weigh-in/batch-tile refinements,
  code-only, PROD.
- Cattle herd missing-dam / exception filters, code-only, PROD. `CattleHerdsView`
  exception filters backed by `src/lib/cattleHerdFilters.js`. (Superseded by the
  2026-06-05 herd-filters rewrite + saved views, migration `095` — see Latest
  Shipped Checkpoint and the Cattle And Sheep contract for the current shape.)
- Broiler on-farm count reconciliation, code-only, PROD. On-farm count derives
  from `src/lib/broiler.js` with a dedicated static guard.
- Legacy Activity composer RPC retirement, migration `080`, PROD. Historical
  composer/count functions remain in SQL but client execute is revoked for anon
  and authenticated roles.
- Processing detach Activity RPCs, migration `081`, PROD. Authenticated cattle
  and sheep processing-batch pages now detach through audited SECDEF RPCs that
  revert animals, clear weigh-in links, and log Activity in one transaction.
- Daily duplicate cleanup and unique indexes, migrations `085` then `084`,
  PROD. Historical duplicate active daily rows were soft-deleted, duplicate
  preflight now passes, and partial unique indexes enforce daily identity for
  poultry, pig, layer, cattle, and sheep daily reports.
- Daily duplicate app handling and equipment maintenance idempotency, migration
  `086`, PROD. Daily report duplicate constraint failures now show friendly
  messages across app edit/create surfaces, offline replay treats superseded
  duplicate dailys as non-stuck, and equipment maintenance events have
  `client_submission_id` idempotency protection against accidental double
  submits without blocking legitimate same-day service entries.
- Cattle forecast Activity log UI, commit `957f577` plus follow-up correction.
  `/cattle/forecast` renders Activity-only logs inside each expanded month
  bucket. Month bucket logs read the `cattle.forecast` stream and filter by
  `payload.month_key` so each month shows only its own Activity.
- Static hardening and inventory guards. The current tree locks source-wide
  table/bucket/env/local storage/API boundaries plus mutation/delete/load/UI
  inventories. Treat the matching static guards as the source of truth for
  current inventory counts.

### No Current Open Gates

There are no active commit, push, PROD migration, storage, deploy, or Vault
gates documented for this checkpoint. If a new session sees a dirty tree, inspect
it before planning; do not assume it is disposable.

Local worktree note: the main CC worktree is at `C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner`
(`main`, HEAD `ad47fee`). The canonical Codex worktree is at
`C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner-codex`, parked on `codex/parallel-worktree` and
resynced to current `main`. No per-lane Codex worktrees remain on disk. Create
new scoped worktrees/branches only for active lanes, and prune them after merge
once Ronnie confirms. Per-lane worktrees need their own `node_modules`
(`npm ci`) and gitignored `.env.test*` to run tests/Playwright. See
[HO.md](HO.md) Parallel Codex Worktree.

### Build Queue

Treat these as product lanes, not hotfixes, unless Ronnie says otherwise.
This is the canonical home for outstanding build/design work; do not scatter
hidden to-do notes through later contract sections.
Shipped 2026-06-04 (removed from queue): authenticated Light-user portal CP1+CP2,
pig planned-trip weight audit, cattle missing-dam herd filters, feed second-tile
current-month pin, broiler on-farm count reconciliation, and task weekly email
correction.
Shipped 2026-06-05 (removed from queue): cattle herd filters / row parity /
saved views (migration `095`), cattle/sheep/pig weigh-in debounce autosave +
Days/delta chips, fixed record-page prev/next nav + broiler batch on the shared
nav, broiler auto-processing on processing date, equipment caught-up home
notices, and Light home alerts with shared `homeAlerts.js` builders.

Detailed parity evidence lives in
`C:\Users\Ronni\cc-research\parity-audit-2026-06-05-CC.md`; line-level findings
stay there, not in this durable map.

Class legend: `DEFECT` = build without a product decision once scoped;
`DECISION` = Ronnie must choose product/UX/policy before build; `ENH` =
enhancement/polish lane.

Next session sprint assignment (Ronnie direction):

- CC owns Sprints 1 + 2 in a fresh scoped worktree/branch from current
  `origin/main`. Sprint 1 is Lane 0 immediate correctness bugs. Sprint 2 is
  Lane A audit/RPC atomicity work. CC should not merge to `main`, should not
  apply PROD migrations, and should report "Done for Codex verification" only
  after build/lint/targeted tests are green with files, migrations, tests, and
  residual risks listed.
- Codex owns Sprints 3 + 4 in one or more separate scoped worktrees/branches
  from current `origin/main`. Sprint 3 is Lane B fail-closed loading parity plus
  Lane C notice/delete-modal primitive parity. Sprint 4 is Lane D save/editing
  model policy plus Lane E record-page shell/chrome parity. Codex should not
  touch CC's worktree or dirty `main`, should not merge to `main`, should not
  apply PROD migrations, and should report "Done for CC verification" only after
  build/lint/targeted tests and focused Playwright where warranted are green.
- Verification/merge rule: CC verifies Codex's Sprint 3/4 work; Codex verifies
  CC's Sprint 1/2 work. Ronnie decides merge order, push, deploy, and any
  TEST/PROD migration gates.

Prompt for CC:

```text
You own Sprints 1 + 2. Do not use or depend on Codex's sprint worktrees. Do not
touch dirty main unless Ronnie explicitly tells you that current lane is ready.

Base from current origin/main in a fresh worktree/branch.

Sprint 1: Lane 0 immediate correctness bugs
- Fix broken InlineNotice prop-shape call sites.
- Add/map the `info` notice kind so benign messages do not render as errors.
- Suppress legacy CowDetail Issues panel inside cattle forecast.
- Lock TasksWebform submitter identity to signed-in user.
- Add/update static guards for InlineNotice contract and locked Tasks submitter.

Sprint 2: Lane A audit/RPC atomicity
- Continue audit-critical mutation hardening from PROJECT.md Lane A.
- Prioritize clearly scoped destructive or multi-table flows.
- Use SECDEF RPCs where atomicity/activity audit is required.
- Extend mutation/activity/delete-recovery guards for touched flows.
- Any migration must be numbered after current PROD series and must not be
  applied without Ronnie approval.

Rules:
- Work in a dedicated worktree/branch, not shared main.
- Do not merge to main.
- Do not apply PROD migrations.
- Run targeted tests, build, lint.
- When done, report exact files changed, migrations added, tests run, pass/fail,
  and residual risks.
- Present "Done for Codex verification" only after your lane is green.
```

Prompt for Codex:

```text
You own Sprints 3 + 4 while CC works Sprints 1 + 2. Ignore dirty main. Work only
from fresh worktrees/branches based on current origin/main.

Sprint 3: Lane B + Lane C
- Fail-closed loading parity:
  - record/list/hub/section-home/My Submissions/admin surfaces should clear
    stale state on load failure.
  - show InlineNotice consistently.
  - expose retry where retry can recover.
  - add/update load retry robustness guards.
- Notice/delete-modal primitive parity:
  - converge destructive/confirmation flows on shared primitives or documented
    exceptions.
  - standardize delete copy, Cancel/Delete placement, typed-confirm phrase,
    Enter/Escape behavior, overlay-click policy, z-index scale, and post-delete
    feedback.
  - extend shared UI extraction/static guards.

Sprint 4: Lane D + Lane E
- Save/editing model policy:
  - codify autosave vs explicit save expectations.
  - fix EquipmentDetail flush-on-blur/before-navigation autosave loss.
  - evaluate broiler weigh-in explicit-save vs autosave parity.
  - add focused save/autosave static guards and touched Playwright where
    appropriate.
- Record-page shell/chrome parity:
  - bring EquipmentDetail and PigBatchPage toward shared record chrome where
    appropriate.
  - standardize record widths and loaded/error hooks.
  - expand recordPageControls adoption.
  - align Sheep daily page structure with the other daily record pages.
  - add record-page shell/chrome guards.

Rules:
- Use separate Codex worktrees if Sprint 3 and Sprint 4 would collide.
- Do not touch CC's worktree or dirty main.
- Do not merge to main.
- Do not apply PROD migrations.
- Run build, lint, targeted static tests, and focused Playwright only where
  touched/risk warrants.
- When done, report exact files changed, tests run, pass/fail, residual risks,
  and say "Done for CC verification."
```

1. Lane 0 - Immediate correctness bugs.
   Class: `DEFECT`. Size: small. Ship first.
   Scope: fix the four broken `InlineNotice` prop-shape call sites, add or map
   the `info` notice kind so benign messages do not render as errors, suppress
   the legacy `CowDetail` Issues panel inside cattle forecast, and lock
   `TasksWebform` submitter identity to the signed-in user.
   Guard target: static coverage for the `InlineNotice` call contract and a
   locked-submitter webform guard/spec.
2. Lane A - Audit, Activity, RPC atomicity, and tombstone/deleted-record design.
   Class: `DEFECT` for destructive flows with no audit; `DECISION` for
   best-effort versus transactional policy on non-destructive edits. Size:
   large.
   Scope: move audit-critical pig, broiler, layer, cattle, and sheep destructive
   or multi-table flows toward audited SECDEF RPCs where needed; make mounted
   Activity streams receive meaningful events; mount the already-populated
   cattle breeding Activity stream; and design the root hard-delete
   tombstone/deleted-record model before expanding physical root deletes.
   Guard target: extend mutation semantics, hard-delete owner, delete/recovery,
   and Activity static guards.
3. Lane B - Fail-closed loading parity.
   Class: `DEFECT`. Size: medium.
   Scope: make record, list, hub, section-home, My Submissions, and admin
   surfaces clear stale state on load failure, show `InlineNotice`, expose
   user-gated Retry where retry can recover, and carry consistent loaded/error
   data hooks.
   Guard target: extend `load_retry_robustness_inventory_static.test.js`.
4. Lane C - Notice and delete-modal primitive parity.
   Class: `DEFECT` for correctness gaps not already handled by Lane 0; `ENH` for
   visual/interaction convergence. Size: medium.
   Scope: converge destructive and confirmation flows on shared primitives or
   documented static-guarded exceptions; standardize delete copy, typed-confirm
   phrase, Cancel/Delete placement, Enter/Escape behavior, overlay-click policy,
   z-index scale, and post-delete feedback.
   Guard target: extend `shared_ui_extraction_contract_static.test.js`.
5. Lane D - Save/editing model policy.
   Class: `DECISION` for the canonical save paradigm; `DEFECT` for known data
   loss windows. Size: medium.
   Scope: define the canonical edit/save behavior by surface type, fix
   EquipmentDetail flush-on-blur/before-navigation autosave loss, decide
   broiler weigh-in explicit-save versus autosave parity, and define how global
   versus local save indicators represent RPC, app-store, and autosave writes.
   Guard target: focused save/autosave static guards plus touched Playwright
   flows.
6. Lane E - Record-page shell and chrome parity.
   Class: `ENH` plus `DEFECT` where page structure causes weaker loading,
   not-found, or Light view-only behavior. Size: medium.
   Scope: bring EquipmentDetail and PigBatchPage onto shared record chrome where
   appropriate, standardize record widths and loaded/error hooks, expand
   `recordPageControls` adoption, and align Sheep daily page structure with the
   other daily record pages.
   Guard target: record-page shell/chrome static guards and focused record-page
   Playwright.
7. Lane F - List, hub, filter, sort, saved-view, and empty-state parity.
   Class: `ENH`. Size: large.
   Scope: bring Sheep Flocks to the Cattle Herds filter-group/multi-sort/saved
   views model, extract drifting row/tile primitives, define which lists get
   search/sort/saved views, standardize filtered/empty states, and keep the real
   AI filter/sort investigation layered on top of deterministic filters with
   explicit preview/apply behavior.
   Guard target: per-surface filter/sort tests, saved-view tests, and static
   shared-row/empty-state guards.
8. Lane G - Restore/recovery surface.
   Class: `DECISION`. Size: small.
   Scope: either add cattle/sheep animal restore UI matching daily Recently
   Deleted recovery, or remove user-facing copy that promises in-app/admin
   restore where no app surface exists.
   Guard target: delete/recovery classification guard plus focused restore UI
   coverage if built.
9. Lane H - Webform/offline parity.
   Class: `DEFECT` for EquipmentFueling offline/stuck recovery gaps; `ENH` for
   consolidation and terminal-copy parity. Size: medium.
   Scope: bring EquipmentFuelingWebform onto the same offline queue and stuck
   recovery expectations as other login-gated forms, consolidate legacy
   webform paths where appropriate without breaking documented aliases, and
   standardize terminal success/queued copy and locked submitter labels.
   Guard target: offline/webform static guards and focused offline Playwright.
10. Lane I - Visual tokens, terminology, formatting, and design primitives.
    Class: `ENH`. Size: large.
    Scope: ratify and enforce the decisions in `## Global Decisions
    (Constitution)` across all surfaces: font scale, button radius/corners,
    button height/padding, dialog stacking, and Save/Submit versus autosave.
    Migrate remaining drift to shared tokens and canonical components before
    adding exceptions.
    Guard target: typography, radius, button-control, z-index, and shared-ui/token
    static guards, plus targeted visual Playwright checks where needed.
11. Lane J - Cross-cutting product and accessibility policy.
    Class: `DECISION`. Size: medium.
    Scope: decide canonical nav IA order, farm-Central date defaults across
    livestock/tasks/webforms, modal keyboard/focus/ARIA behavior, image alt text
    policy, and any baseline home-dashboard KPI rules where program differences
    still need a uniform frame.
    Guard target: route/nav/date/a11y static guards plus focused Playwright once
    decisions are made.
12. Lane K - Export/print parity.
    Class: `DECISION` plus `ENH`. Size: medium.
    Scope: add a shared CSV/export/print model for operational lists and record
    pages, starting from Ronnie's cattle herd need. One export/download owner
    should own rows-to-CSV, Blob/object URL, filename, and revoke mechanics;
    exports should use active filtered/sorted view state and shared column specs;
    permissions must remain bounded to already-allowed/RLS-visible rows; print
    should use a shared print view/stylesheet rather than per-section print
    islands; filename dates should use the farm-Central convention.
    Guard target: a static single-download-owner guard, column-spec/export
    tests, and print stylesheet/screenshot checks.

### Light-User Portal Contract

Locked product direction (do not re-litigate without Ronnie): authenticated-only
submission is the durable path. The migration `083` public-webform identity
approach stays shelved; do NOT build roster-id -> profile-id mapping.

Shipped contract:
- `light` is a real authenticated role managed through the normal user-management
  authority path.
- Former public report/form URLs stay valid but now require login; logged-out
  access redirects through login and returns to the requested URL.
- Submitter/team-member identity is the signed-in user and is displayed locked.
  Client-provided profile IDs are never authority.
- Light users land on a contained portal with only allowed surfaces: webform hub,
  daily report forms, six daily list/record views, Add Feed, equipment
  fueling/checklist, fuel supply, Tasks, legacy pig daily form, and My
  Submissions.
- Weigh-ins are intentionally not a Light surface.
- Light can read all daily report records in the allowed daily surfaces,
  including legacy rows, but can edit/delete only rows where
  `owner_profile_id = auth.uid()`. Legacy NULL-owner rows are read-only for
  Light.
- `owner_profile_id` is server-stamped by migration `089` on insert across the 9
  report tables. Offline replay stamps the authenticated user performing the
  replay; stored client profile IDs are ignored.
- Daily edit/delete writes route through `update_daily_report` and
  `soft_delete_daily_report`; direct client UPDATE/DELETE on daily tables is
  revoked by migration `092`.
- Equipment fueling and fuel supply own-record edits/deletes for Light happen in
  My Submissions through ownership RPCs. Privileged fleet/admin surfaces remain
  available to privileged roles under RLS/RPC controls.
- The Light home portal (`LightHomePortal.jsx`) shows read-only alert cards above
  the shortcut grid — Missed Daily Reports and Equipment Attention — plus a
  Next-30 events list below (only when there are events). These reuse the shared
  `src/dashboard/homeAlerts.js` builders. RLS, not UI, is the boundary: a real
  `light` user must be able to read `app_store`/equipment/`equipment_fuelings`
  for these cards, proven behaviorally by `tests/light_home_alerts.spec.js`
  (real Light auth user, not the client-only role override).

Guard rails: `light_user_portal_static.test.js`,
`daily_edit_surface_static.test.js`, `daily_soft_delete_static.test.js`, and
`cp2_daily_writes_via_rpc_static.test.js` lock the route/nav/access and
ownership-write contracts.

---

## Intentional Non-Uniformities

These differences are current product/architecture decisions, not parity defects
unless Ronnie changes the contract:

- Light users are intentionally excluded from `/weighins`; they stay contained
  to the allowed report/form, Tasks, and My Submissions surfaces.
- Migration `083` public webform submitter identity stays shelved. Do not build
  roster-id -> profile-id mapping; authenticated submitter identity is the
  durable path.
- `/webform-pigs` remains a valid legacy standalone pig daily form route/alias
  while legacy compatibility is required. Consolidation must preserve aliases.
- `egg_dailys` is intentionally not covered by the daily unique-index backstop
  and has no daily photo column/surface. Egg duplicate prevention is warning /
  pre-submit only unless a later schema lane changes it.
- Add Feed quick-log rows are not full daily reports, and missed-report checks
  exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Broiler, layer, and pig daily pages use Group copy rather than Batch copy.
- Pig planned-trip forecast weights are render-only. Latest weigh-ins do not
  change planned-trip forecast weights automatically.
- Program dashboards may show program-specific KPIs. Lane J can define a shared
  dashboard frame/baseline, but it must not force identical metrics where the
  programs genuinely differ.
- The public `#webform-container` styling (gradient submit, brand-tinted shadow,
  larger font, scoped input padding) is an intentionally self-contained design
  system, separate from the React app tokens in `## Design System`. It is not
  token drift and is excluded from the app token migration.
- `getReadableText()` in `src/lib/styles.js` returns `#0f172a`/`white` as
  auto-contrast for arbitrary colored backgrounds. These two values are
  infrastructure, not palette drift, and are exempt from the color migration.

---

## Product Surface

### Authenticated App

- Home dashboard.
- Broiler: home, timeline, batches, feed, dailys, weigh-ins.
- Pig: home, breeding, farrowing, sows, batches, feed, dailys, weigh-ins.
- Layer: home, groups, batches, dailys, eggs.
- Cattle: home, herds, breeding, forecast, processing batches, dailys,
  weigh-ins.
- Sheep: home, flocks, processing batches, dailys, weigh-ins.
- Equipment/Fleet: `/fleet` with fleet list, fuel log, and equipment detail.
- Task Center: `/tasks`.
- Light portal: contained home for `role=light`, allowed webform/daily shortcuts,
  Tasks, and My Submissions.
- Global Activity: `/activity`.
- Admin/config: `/admin`.
- Admin runtime observability: `/admin/client-errors`.

### Login-Gated Form URLs

- Former public report/form URLs are now authenticated. Existing paths and
  aliases stay valid, redirect logged-out users to login, and return to the
  requested URL after auth.
- `/dailys` and `/dailys/tasks`.
- `/addfeed`.
- `/weighins`.
- `/equipment` and `/equipment/<slug>`.
- `/fuel-supply`.
- `/webform-pigs` legacy standalone pig daily form.
- Legacy aliases redirect through `src/lib/routes.js`. Do not add alias logic
  outside that owner.
- Light users are allowed through the contained report/form surfaces but are not
  allowed into `/weighins`.

### Operational Record Pages

Record pages are durable per-entity workspaces. They own record details,
Comments, collapsed Activity log, sequence navigation where appropriate, and
fail-closed loading.

Live Activity entity types and routes:

| Entity type         | Route                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `task.instance`     | `/tasks/<id>`                      |
| `cattle.animal`     | `/cattle/herds/<id>`               |
| `sheep.animal`      | `/sheep/flocks/<id>`               |
| `cattle.processing` | `/cattle/batches/<id>`             |
| `sheep.processing`  | `/sheep/batches/<id>`              |
| `broiler.batch`     | `/broiler/batches/<encoded name>`  |
| `pig.batch`         | `/pig/batches/<group id>`          |
| `layer.batch`       | `/layer/batches/<id>`              |
| `layer.housing`     | `/layer/housings/<id>`             |
| `equipment.item`    | `/fleet/<id>`                      |
| `poultry.daily`     | `/broiler/dailys/<id>`             |
| `layer.daily`       | `/layer/dailys/<id>`               |
| `egg.daily`         | `/layer/eggs/<id>`                 |
| `pig.daily`         | `/pig/dailys/<id>`                 |
| `cattle.daily`      | `/cattle/dailys/<id>`              |
| `sheep.daily`       | `/sheep/dailys/<id>`               |
| `weighin.session`   | `/weigh-in-sessions/<id>`          |
| `cattle.forecast`   | `/cattle/forecast`                 |
| `cattle.breeding`   | `/cattle/breeding`                 |

No operational record workspace should reintroduce legacy `ActivityPanel` or
`ActivityModal`. Comments are discussion; Activity is audit/history.

Record-page prev/next sequence navigation is owned by the shared
`RecordSequenceNav` (Prev pinned to the left screen edge, Next to the right,
vertically centered — broiler side-nav placement). Broiler batch pages use the
shared component; the old bespoke `BatchForm` side-nav was removed. Nav renders
only when route state carries a valid sequence; direct links/notifications get
no nav.

---

## Backend And Data State

### Supabase Migrations

Current PROD architecture includes these load-bearing migrations:

- `057` notifications.
- `058` `activity_events` and `activity_mentions` foundation.
- `060` Activity mention contract.
- `062` Activity entity expansion.
- `063` notification activity resolution.
- `064` Activity Phase 2 entities.
- `065` Global Activity Log.
- `066` Activity change events.
- `067` daily soft-delete.
- `068` `client_error_events` and `record_client_error`.
- `069` `cattle.animal` soft-delete/restore.
- `070` daily delete for active roles.
- `071` Comments foundation.
- `072` weigh-in session Activity entity.
- `073` `comment-photos` Storage RLS.
- `074` `sheep.animal` soft-delete/restore.
- `075` animal transfer Activity RPCs.
- `076` `cattle.forecast` Activity entity.
- `077` `list_client_errors` admin read RPC.
- `078` `cattle.breeding` Activity entity.
- `079` `delete_cattle_calving_record` RPC.
- `080` legacy Activity composer RPC retirement.
- `081` authenticated processing-detach Activity RPCs.
- `084` daily report partial unique indexes.
- `085` daily duplicate cleanup.
- `086` equipment maintenance event idempotency.
- `087` `profiles.role` adds `light` to the CHECK constraint.
- `088` `owner_profile_id` columns + partial indexes on the 6 daily tables,
  `daily_submissions`, `equipment_fuelings`, `fuel_supplies`.
- `089` `stamp_owner_profile_id` BEFORE INSERT trigger (`trg_stamp_owner`)
  stamping `owner_profile_id := auth.uid()` on all 9 tables; never client-set.
- `090` `fuel_supplies` authenticated INSERT policy (CP1 login-gating fix).
- `091` ownership RPCs: `update_daily_report` (positive per-table column
  allowlist + server-side `field.updated` diff), `soft_delete_daily_report`
  ownership branch, `update_equipment_fueling`, `delete_equipment_fueling`,
  `update_fuel_supply`, and `delete_fuel_supply`.
  Light may mutate only rows where `owner_profile_id = auth.uid()`.
- `092` ownership enforce (red-switch): REVOKE direct UPDATE/DELETE on the 6
  daily tables, `trg_freeze_owner` BEFORE UPDATE trigger, privileged-only RLS on
  `equipment_fuelings`/`fuel_supplies`.
- `093` task weekly email correction: Sunday 8am America/Chicago digest with
  dual UTC cron entries, helper-side DST gating, previous-Sunday-08:00-Central
  windowing, and completed-assigned task coverage.
- `094` audited RPC follow-ups: cattle breeding cycle upsert/delete and sheep
  lambing delete through authenticated SECDEF RPCs with transactional Activity
  writes.
- `095` `app_saved_views`: generic per-surface saved views
  (`id, surface_key, name, visibility, view_state jsonb, owner_profile_id,
  created_at, updated_at`). Server-trusted ownership — BEFORE INSERT trigger
  stamps `owner_profile_id := auth.uid()`; BEFORE UPDATE freezes owner +
  refreshes `updated_at`. RLS: public-or-owner SELECT, owner-only
  INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE; grants to `authenticated` only. First consumer is the
  cattle herds list (`surface_key = 'cattle.herds'`) via
  `src/lib/savedViewsApi.js`. Direct client CRUD is acceptable here because
  RLS scopes every operation (saved views are user preferences, not
  audit-critical entity writes). Applied TEST + PROD 2026-06-05.
- `096` processing attach Activity RPCs: authenticated cattle/sheep
  Send-to-Processor attach flows now use SECDEF RPCs that update processing
  batch detail, animal processed state, transfer audit rows, weigh-in stamps,
  and Activity atomically. Authenticated has EXECUTE; anon/PUBLIC are revoked.
  Applied TEST + PROD 2026-06-06.

Special migration notes:

- `082` is intentionally unused.
- `083` public webform submitter identity is shelved and must not be applied
  unless Ronnie reverses the auth-only webform direction.
- `085` was applied before `084` in PROD so duplicate active daily identities
  were cleaned up before the unique indexes were created.
- `061_daily_report_soft_delete_restore.sql` is superseded by `067`.
- New or changed SECDEF RPC return shapes need
  `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`.
- PROD `exec_sql` is forbidden. Apply PROD SQL with `psql` and
  `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` per [HO.md](HO.md).

### Storage Buckets And Media

Known document/photo surfaces are locked by static guards:

- `daily-photos`.
- `task-photos`.
- `task-request-photos`.
- `comment-photos`.
- `equipment-maintenance-docs`.
- `fuel-bills`.
- `cattle-feed-pdfs`.
- `batch-documents`.

Append-only upload expectations:

- Uploads use `upsert: false` unless a lane explicitly changes the contract.
- Duplicate-object errors are treated as retry success where the upload path is
  idempotent.
- Private buckets use signed URLs; public buckets use public URLs.
- No code should mutate `storage.objects` directly.

---

## Architecture Map

### Stack

- React 18 / Vite SPA.
- Supabase JS client from `src/lib/supabase.js` only.
- React Router DOM.
- `idb` for IndexedDB/offline queue.
- Playwright for e2e.
- Vitest for unit/static tests.
- ESLint + Prettier.
- Netlify production deploy from `main`.

### Important Files

- `src/main.jsx`: app shell, view routing, auth-gated view rendering, global
  modals.
- `src/lib/routes.js`: canonical route map and aliases.
- `src/lib/activityRegistry.js`: client entity registry, labels, and routes.
- `src/lib/activityApi.js` and `src/lib/globalActivityApi.js`: Activity RPC
  clients.
- `src/lib/commentsApi.js` and `src/shared/CommentsSection.jsx`: Comments
  system.
- `src/shared/RecordPageShell.jsx`: shared record-page chrome.
- `src/shared/RecordCollaborationSection.jsx`: Comments + Activity composition.
- `src/shared/RecordActivityLog.jsx`: audit-only record Activity view.
- `src/shared/RecordSequenceNav.jsx`: fixed prev/next record navigation pinned to
  the left/right screen edges (broiler side-nav placement).
- `src/dashboard/homeAlerts.js`: single source of truth for home/Light alert
  builders (`buildNext30Events`, `buildMissedDailyReports`,
  `buildEquipmentAttention`, `foldEquipmentFuelings`), shared by
  `HomeDashboard` and `LightHomePortal`.
- `src/lib/savedViewsApi.js`: `app_saved_views` CRUD + `buildViewState`
  (first consumer: cattle herds list).
- `src/lib/cattleHerdFilters.js`: pure cattle herd filter/sort predicates
  (vitest-locked).
- `src/shared/InlineNotice.jsx`: non-blocking notices.
- `src/shared/DeleteModal.jsx` and `src/shared/ConfirmModal.jsx`: app modal
  primitives.
- `src/lib/entityMutations.js`: shared best-effort mutation + Activity helper.
- `src/lib/clientErrorReporting.js` and `src/admin/ClientErrorsView.jsx`:
  runtime error capture and admin review.

### Route Ownership

- `src/lib/routes.js` owns canonical paths and legacy aliases.
- `src/lib/activityRegistry.js` owns entity-to-record routes for Activity and
  notifications.
- `main.jsx` adapts URLs into view state. Do not add separate alias maps in
  views.

### Authentication And Roles

- Ronnie remains final gate owner.
- App roles include admin, management, farm_team, equipment_tech, light, and
  inactive.
- Runtime permission decisions must be enforced by RLS/RPCs, not just hidden UI.
- Report/form submission is login-required. The session user is the submitter;
  `owner_profile_id` is stamped server-side and client-supplied profile IDs are
  not trusted.

---

## Design System

### Typography

- Canonical font family: `Geist` stack from `index.html` and inheritance from
  `fontFamily: 'inherit'` on component styles.
- Canonical font-size set: `10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 26`.
- Allowed display sizes: `32, 34, 36, 48, 56`.
- Font-weight scale: `400, 500, 600, 700` only; `800` is forbidden.

### Spacing and controls

- Standard button pad is `10px 16px`.
- Standard button vertical pad is `10px`.
- Inputs/selects/textareas use radius `6`, border `1px #d1d5db`, pad `8px 11px`
  and brand focus treatment.

### Radius

- Canonical radius tokens are `4`, `6`, `10`, `14`, `999`, and `'50%'`.
- The values `7` and `8` are retired.

### Stacking and elevation

- Dialog layer order keeps Confirm/Delete at toast `9000`; other overlays and
  modals remain below that tier in the shared z-index ladder.

### Save model

- Explicit Save/Submit by surface class is mandatory for submit-style flows.
  Autosave is mandatory for edit-in-place flows. Lane D owns migration and any
  residual exceptions.

### Canonical components

- Use canonical role owners before introducing equivalent alternatives.
- Canonical owners include `RecordPageShell`, `RecordSequenceNav`,
  `recordPageControls`, and modal primitives.

## Load-Bearing Contracts

### Cross-App Rules

- Do not bypass RLS with client-side assumptions.
- Do not add browser secrets beyond approved `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`,
  `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and approved dev/test flags.
- Do not create new Supabase clients outside `src/lib/supabase.js`.
- Do not use raw browser `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt` in product surfaces.
- Do not add route aliases outside `src/lib/routes.js`.
- Do not edit docs during normal build/hotfix lanes unless Ronnie explicitly
  asks for docs or wrap work.

### Cold-Boot And Fail-Closed Loading

Data surfaces must fail closed on load errors:

- Record pages render in this order: loading -> loadError -> not-found -> record.
- List/hub surfaces expose `data-<surface>-loaded` markers and gate rows/empty
  states behind `!loadError`.
- Load failures clear stale rows/state, show `InlineNotice`, and should provide a
  user-gated Retry.
- Sidecar reads may degrade best-effort only when the primary record/list load
  is valid.
- Header badge counts soft-fail; Header panel content fails closed.

Load/retry readiness is inventoried by
`load_retry_robustness_inventory_static.test.js`; changed surfaces must update
the guard deliberately.

### Activity, Comments, Mentions, Notifications

- Activity is audit/system history. Comments are user discussion.
- Runtime Activity access goes through SECDEF RPCs: `list_activity_events`,
  `list_global_activity`, `record_activity_event`, and domain-specific SECDEF
  RPCs that insert `activity_events`.
- No direct client `.from('activity_events')` or
  `.from('activity_mentions')`.
- No direct client `.from('comments')` or `.from('comment_edits')`.
- Legacy Activity composer/count RPCs (`post_activity_comment`,
  `edit_activity_event`, `delete_activity_event`, `count_activity_for_entity`)
  remain defined in historical SQL with no runtime callers, and migration `080`
  revoked client execute for anon and authenticated. Do not use them.
- `RecordActivityLog` filters `comment.posted` and shows audit only.
- `CommentsSection` owns user discussion, attachments, edit history, soft
  delete, and mentions.
- Mention bodies stay human-readable `@Name`. UUIDs do not appear in body text.
- Mention notifications route to the operational record page and target comment.
- Valid notification types: `task_completed`, `mention`, `comment_mention`.
- Notification writes happen inside SECDEF paths. Client code must not insert or
  delete notifications.
- `task_completed` notifications skip null creator and self-completion.

### Activity Entity Additions

A new Activity entity requires all of this:

- SQL `_activity_can_read` branch.
- `activityRegistry` entry.
- Route/deep-link mapping.
- Permission and existence semantics.
- Record or workflow surface.
- Static test coverage.
- Activity/event logging strategy.

Workflow/worktable entities:

- `cattle.forecast` uses entity_id `cattle-forecast`; Forecast month bucket
  logs filter that stream by `payload.month_key`.
- `cattle.breeding` uses entity_id `cattle-breeding`.
- These are table/workflow audit streams. Their `_activity_can_read` branches
  are program-gated rather than row-existence gated.

### Entity Mutations And Audit Atomicity

- `runMutation` is for routine client-side mutations with best-effort Activity.
- `runMutation` must not know table names or business rules.
- `runMutation` is not transactional. If Activity fails after a successful data
  write, the data is already committed.
- Audit-critical delete/restore/transfer/status flows should move to SECDEF RPCs
  that mutate data and insert Activity in one transaction.
- Mutation inventory counts live in
  `mutation_semantics_inventory_static.test.js`. New mutation sites must update
  that guard deliberately.

### Delete, Restore, And Recovery

- Hard-delete owner inventory lives in `hard_delete_owner_static.test.js`.
  Legitimate new hard-delete owners must update that guard deliberately.
- Soft-delete protected roots must not have direct client deletes: cattle, sheep,
  `cattle_dailys`, `sheep_dailys`, `poultry_dailys`, `layer_dailys`,
  `egg_dailys`, `pig_dailys`.
- Daily reports soft-delete through `soft_delete_daily_report` and restore
  through `restore_daily_report`.
- Cattle/sheep animals soft-delete/restore through their animal RPCs.
- Calving sub-row delete goes through `delete_cattle_calving_record` and logs
  `record.deleted` on the dam's `cattle.animal`.

### Cattle And Sheep

- Cattle and sheep use dedicated Supabase tables, not `app_store`.
- Active cattle herds: `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, `bulls`.
- Active sheep flocks: `rams`, `ewes`, `feeders`.
- Outcome states are `processed`, `deceased`, `sold`.
- Cattle soft-delete/restore: `soft_delete_cattle_animal`,
  `restore_cattle_animal`.
- Sheep soft-delete/restore: `soft_delete_sheep_animal`,
  `restore_sheep_animal`.
- Animal restores reject active tag conflicts.
- Normal reads filter `deleted_at IS NULL`.
- Admin can inspect deleted rows where RLS/RPC supports it.
- No cattle/sheep table DELETE policy should exist for client hard-delete.
- Manual transfer goes through `transfer_cattle_animal` /
  `transfer_sheep_animal`: row update + transfer row + `status.changed`
  Activity in one transaction.
- Processing-batch helpers may need to resolve deleted animals by ID in admin
  context; do not add `deleted_at` filters there without redesign.
- Cattle Herds filters/sorts live in `src/lib/cattleHerdFilters.js` (pure,
  vitest-locked); UI is `CattleHerdsView`. Filters render in three
  always-visible groups (Core, Calving/Breeding, Lineage/Other) — no "More
  filters" toggle, no Exceptions group, and no plain-English/Parse smart
  assistant. See Build Queue for the real AI filter/sort investigation.
- Non-calving is a single "No calf since [date]" control: mature cow/heifer
  (30+ months) whose last calving is missing OR before the date. Backward
  compatibility — `filters.nonCalvingCows === true` still means the
  9-months-ago default in the predicate, but the checkbox is no longer exposed.
  A `nonCalving` sort key ranks candidates first/last.
- `Unmatched Calves` is a checkbox-style filter pushed to the right of
  Lineage/Other: any sex, no matched dam, born in the last 4 months or missing
  DOB (`filters.unmatchedCalves === true`). Exception predicates compose as OR
  and still compose with herd/normal filters/search. Last-calved lookup is by
  current tag, not old tags (accepted edge).
- Flat and grouped rows render through one shared `CowListRow`, so calf count +
  last-calved metadata cannot drift between the two views (shown for females).
- Saved views: `src/lib/savedViewsApi.js` over `app_saved_views`
  (`surface_key = 'cattle.herds'`). Any authenticated user saves private or
  public views capturing `{filters, sortRules, viewMode}`; public-or-owner
  visibility, owner-only update/delete, RLS-enforced. Load failures degrade to a
  disabled picker + inline notice (the list still works).

### Daily Reports

- Daily reports have dedicated record pages for poultry, layer, egg, pig, cattle,
  and sheep.
- All six open directly editable; no edit-mode toggle.
- Daily duplicate prevention (identity = date + batch_label for poultry/pig/
  layer, date + herd for cattle, date + flock for sheep; Add Feed rows excluded):
  - DB-enforced for those five tables by partial unique indexes (`084`); the
    one-time historical duplicate cleanup (`085`) ran first in PROD.
  - The client pre-submit guard (`src/lib/dailyDuplicateCheck.js`) still runs;
    the indexes are the backstop for edit-to-collide, races, and offline replay.
  - A constraint violation surfaces a friendly "report already exists" message
    across edit/create surfaces, and offline replay discards superseded
    duplicate dailys instead of sticking (`086` lane).
  - `egg_dailys` is intentionally NOT indexed — warning/pre-submit guard only.
- Add Feed quick-log rows are not full daily reports.
- Missed-report checks exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Daily edits route through `updateDailyReport` / `update_daily_report` so
  server-side allowlists, casts, ownership checks, and Activity diffs own the
  write. Do not reintroduce direct daily-table `.update()` calls.
- Daily deletes route through `soft_delete_daily_report`. Do not reintroduce
  direct client deletes for daily roots.
- `canEditOwnRecord(authState, record)` and
  `canDeleteDailyReport(authState, record)` mirror server rules: privileged
  roles can mutate allowed daily rows, Light can mutate only its own
  `owner_profile_id = auth.uid()` rows, inactive cannot mutate, and legacy
  NULL-owner rows are Light read-only.
- Admin Recently Deleted supports daily restore.
- Broiler/layer/pig daily pages use Group copy, not Batch copy.
- Layer daily group and `batch_id` resolution must go through
  `src/layer/layerDailyGroups.js`.

### Pig

- Pig feeder group started counts are authoritative.
- Current count is ledger-derived, not persisted `currentCount`.
- `pig.batch` record pages own metadata, sub-batches, mortality, planned trips,
  processing trips, forecast/current/FCR, send-to-trip source display, Comments,
  and Activity.
- Keep pig batch workflow split across `PigBatchPage`, `PigBatchHubTile`,
  `usePigMortality`, `usePigSubBatches`, `usePigPlannedTrips`, and
  `usePigProcessingTrips`.
- `PigContext.feedersLoaded` is the readiness boundary.
- Farm-born feeder batches are created from farrowing cycles, not manually from
  `/pig/batches`.
- Planned-trip row shape stays `{id, date, sex, subBatchId, plannedCount,
  order}`.
- Planned-trip locks live only in `ppp-pig-planned-trip-locks-v1`.
- `processingTrips[].subAttributions` stores `{subId, subBatchName, sex, count}`.
- Send-to-Trip may reconcile locked planned trip count but cannot change locked
  date.
- Planned-trip forecast weights are render-only and based on DOB/farrowing age
  at trip date times Global ADG. Latest weigh-ins do not change planned-trip
  forecast weights.
- Farrowing-age distribution uses the parent farrowing window and is scaled to
  sub-batches. Planned trips slice oldest-to-youngest; already shipped pigs are
  offset from the oldest side. Missing farrowing data falls back to the
  estimated-cycle band and is marked estimated; 1-pig projections show the full
  band.
- Processing trips show Forecast vs Actual with delta, display-only, so Ronnie
  can compare shipped results against the Global ADG model without auto-changing
  ADG.
- Weigh-in entry tiles show previous weigh-in/date and rank-matched per-pig ADG
  when a prior session exists. Blank notes are hidden behind `+ Note`; existing
  notes still show.
- Pig weigh-in entry autosaves; the tile shows a days-since-last-weigh-in delta
  alongside the previous session so the gap between weigh-ins is visible at a
  glance.
- Pig batch hub tiles show started count, current count, feed per pig started,
  and sub-batch chips.

### Broiler, Layers, And Feed Planning

- Broiler batches live in `ppp-v4`.
- Login-gated `/weighins` cannot read or mutate `app_store.ppp-v4` directly.
- Week 4/6 completion uses `stamp_broiler_batch_avg` RPC.
- Layer `current_count` is the physical anchor; projected count subtracts
  mortalities since anchor.
- Feed math lives in `src/lib/feedPlanner.js` and `src/lib/feedOrderBasis.js`.
- Feed-order recommendations use the latest active-month physical count when
  present; otherwise they fall back to previous-month estimate.
- Poultry feed-order math is per feed type: starter, grower, layerfeed.
- "Count includes `<month>` order" prevents double-counting the delivery.
- The "Order for `<active>`" tile labels its basis.
- The second feed summary tile for pig and broiler stays pinned to the current
  calendar month estimate via `estTileYM`; feed-order entry may advance the
  workflow `activeYM` without rolling this estimate tile forward.
- Broiler on-farm counts are centralized in `computeBroilerOnFarmCounts` in
  `src/lib/broiler.js`. "Birds on Farm" means projected live birds after
  mortality; "Birds Started" is shown separately. Home and Broiler Home use the
  same helper.
- Broiler batch status auto-advances in `loadAllData` (`src/main.jsx`):
  `shouldAutoActivateBroilerBatch` promotes planned -> active on/after the hatch
  date, then `shouldAutoProcessBroilerBatch` (both in `src/lib/broiler.js`)
  promotes active -> processed on/after the processing date (inclusive of
  today). Auto-process runs after auto-activation within the same `ppp-v4`
  migration map and persists before the webform mirror sync reads the store.

### Tasks

- `/tasks` is canonical. `/my-tasks` and `/admin/tasks` are aliases only.
- Task writes go through v2 wrappers/RPCs.
- Frontend must not call `generate_system_task_instance`.
- `task_instance_photos` is canonical. Legacy single-photo columns are display
  fallback only.
- Task assignee dropdowns use `loadTaskAssignableProfilesById` and fail closed
  on `webform_config` read errors.
- Header task badge soft-fails and must not break Header rendering.
- The `task_completed` notification contract is covered by Playwright.
- Weekly task email (`tasks-summary-weekly`, migration `093`) runs Sunday 8am
  America/Chicago via dual UTC cron entries with helper-side DST gating; the
  weekly window starts at the previous Sunday 8am Central. Recipients are open
  assignees unioned with completed-assigned recipients (completed-task notices
  owed to creators/assignors via `task_completed` notifications); assigned-only
  recipients still get email, both-empty recipients are skipped.

### Equipment

- Logged-in equipment lives under `/fleet`.
- Login-gated equipment checklist/fueling lives under `/equipment`.
- Equipment fueling submissions use `submit_equipment_fueling` RPC.
- Light My Submissions edits/deletes its own equipment fuelings and fuel
  supplies through ownership RPCs. Privileged `/fleet` and admin fuel-log
  surfaces retain their privileged paths under RLS/RPC controls.
- Fuel-log edit/delete paths recompute current readings from remaining fuel logs.
- Equipment checklist/material edits must not reload, lose focus, or reorder list
  items on click/edit.
- Rolling material clears are bucketed by due service cycle.
- `equipment_maintenance_events` has `client_submission_id` idempotency (`086`):
  a double-tap "Add Event" collapses to a no-op. This is idempotency, not
  date-uniqueness — multiple legitimate same-day service events are still
  allowed. Fuelings and `fuel_supplies` already had `client_submission_id`
  idempotency (`030`).
- Home equipment tiles show caught-up notices when all equipment maintenance and
  all equipment materials are current, mirroring the "no missing daily reports"
  state (`showEquipmentMaintenanceCaughtUp` / `showEquipmentMaterialsCaughtUp`
  in `HomeDashboard`, fed by `buildEquipmentAttention` in
  `src/dashboard/homeAlerts.js`).
- Admin client error review is at `/admin/client-errors` and reads through
  `list_client_errors` only.

### Login-Gated Webforms And Offline Queue

- Login-gated webforms must not read `app_store` directly or use browser
  secrets.
- Former public forms now use Supabase auth state intentionally for login and
  locked submitter identity. The signed-in session user is the submitter;
  client-supplied profile IDs are never trusted.
- Light is allowed only on contained report/form surfaces; weigh-ins remain
  outside the Light allowlist.
- Offline queue IndexedDB ownership is centralized in `src/lib/offlineQueue.js`.
- Offline RPC replay goes through `useOfflineRpcSubmit` where needed.
- Ownership stamping is server-side on replay: the replaying authenticated user
  becomes `owner_profile_id`.
- Shared TEST DB Playwright specs that reset/seed the DB must run one file at a
  time.

### Storage And File Inputs

- Upload owner/count guards are intentionally brittle.
- New upload/remove/signed/public URL owners require updating the matching static
  guard.
- Task, daily, and comment attachment uploads are append-only.
- Image file inputs intentionally omit `capture=` so mobile users can choose
  camera or library upload through the native picker.

### Runtime Observability

- `client_error_events` records redacted browser/runtime errors through
  `record_client_error`.
- `/admin/client-errors` is read-only, admin-gated, fail-closed, paginated, and
  uses `list_client_errors`.
- Client error reporting must not store raw localStorage, auth tokens, full
  payloads, or secret-like data.

### Shared UI And Record Chrome

- Design tokens and visual contract details are in `## Design System`.

- `RecordPageShell` owns record-page frame/loading/not-found/body/title chrome.
- `RecordCollaborationSection` is the only component that composes
  `CommentsSection` and `RecordActivityLog`.
- `RecordActivityLog` is audit-only and filters `comment.posted`.
- `RecordSequenceNav` is the shared sequence-navigation primitive: fixed flat
  pills pinned to the left (Prev) and right (Next) screen edges, vertically
  centered, with a small bottom-center "i of n" pill. Hooks
  (`data-record-seq-nav/-prev/-next/-position/-fixed`) are locked by the
  `*_sequence_nav.spec.js` suites. Note the fixed-position gotchas: the
  container must carry no CSS transform (a transformed ancestor re-anchors
  `position:fixed` children to itself), and the position pill stays in-flow so
  the container has a real, visible box.
- `app_saved_views` saved views are a generic per-surface primitive
  (`savedViewsApi.js`, `surface_key`); the cattle herds list is the first
  consumer. New consumers reuse the same table/API with a distinct
  `surface_key`.
- `DeleteModal` and `ConfirmModal` are app-level modal primitives. New
  destructive/confirmation flows should use them unless a documented exception
  is added to `shared_ui_extraction_contract_static.test.js`.
- Record page controls live in `src/shared/recordPageControls.jsx`.

### Source Boundary Guards

Static guards now lock these boundaries. If a legitimate new owner is added,
update the guard in the same lane and explain why:

- Supabase client owner.
- Browser secret/env usage.
- `app_store`, `webform_config`, `profiles` access.
- `localStorage` owner/key inventory.
- IndexedDB/offline queue owner.
- Notifications client-write prohibition.
- Task API boundary.
- Comments/Activity table access.
- Route alias ownership.
- Light portal/access boundary.
- Login-gated webforms boundary.
- Storage upload/remove/signed/public URL ownership.
- Append-only bucket upload contracts.
- Image file input capture contract.
- Hard-delete owner inventory.
- Mutation semantics inventory.
- CP2 daily writes via ownership RPCs.
- Delete/recovery classification.
- Legacy Activity retirement.
- Load/retry readiness inventory.
- Shared UI extraction contract.

Playwright notes:

- Specs that reset the shared TEST DB must run one file at a time.
- Local dev-server cold-start can hang if stray node/vite processes remain in
  old worktrees. Clear stale processes before diagnosing product flake.
- The forecast Activity Playwright spec shipped but historically hit local
  cold-start setup timeouts; static and direct TEST checks covered the contract.

## Agent Session Checklist

Before a new lane:

1. Read [HO.md](HO.md).
2. Read Current State, Build Queue, and the relevant contracts here.
3. Run `git status --short` and inspect recent `git log`.
4. Identify dirty-tree risk, active worktrees, open gates, and migration state.
5. Inspect files in scope before planning.
6. If touching a boundary guard, update the guard in the same lane.
7. If touching SQL/RPC/RLS/Storage, state TEST/PROD apply and verification needs
   in the plan.
8. If approving a commit gate, queue the next CC-ready prompt in the same Codex
   response per [HO.md](HO.md).
