# WCF Planner

Farm-management web app for White Creek Farm. React/Vite single-page app,
Supabase backend, Netlify production deploy from GitHub `main`.

This file is the durable project map: current state, architecture, roadmap, and
load-bearing contracts. Workflow, roles, gates, and relay format live in
[HO.md](HO.md). Do not turn this file into a session transcript.

Last updated: 2026-07-14.
Product checkpoint covered by this wrap: `5354a79` (Processing planner integration
through migrations `175`-`177`, final-stage workflow, production correction,
public hub header polish, and the simplified Processing schedule UI). Last
code/product checkpoint: `5354a79`. This documentation-only wrap follows that
product commit and records the remaining build queue.
Shipped history lives in `git log` and `archive/SESSION_LOG.md`; durable behavior
lives in the Load-Bearing Contracts below; migration/live state lives in Current
State and Backend And Data State. Do not re-enumerate the changelog in this header.
Production URL: https://wcfplanner.com.
Netlify auto-deploys from GitHub `main`.

## Start Here

1. Read [HO.md](HO.md) for workflow, roles, gates, relay format, and
   parallel-worktree rules.
2. Read this file's Current State, Build Queue, and the relevant contracts.
3. Run `git status --short`, `git worktree list`, and inspect recent `git log`
   before planning or editing.
4. Inspect the source/test/migration files in scope before changing anything.

Default session model: Codex plans/reviews, CC builds/validates, Ronnie approves
commit/push/PROD gates. Ronnie may explicitly assign Codex build work; otherwise
CC is the primary builder.

## Project Map Governance

This file is a docs-as-code project map, not a session log, scratchpad, or
append-only changelog.

Rules for editing this file:

- Build Queue is the only home for outstanding build/design work. Do not hide
  "future", "needs", "still needs", "TODO", or "TBD" work in later sections.
- Contract sections describe current architecture, standards, and guard rails.
  If a contract is aspirational rather than true, move the work to Build Queue
  and state the current guard/inventory honestly.
- Current State summarizes what is true now, including active local worktree risk
  when it matters. Recent Shipped Checkpoints summarize work merged to
  `origin/main`.
- Inventory counts, migration state, test names, and owner lists must match the
  source/static guards at the time of edit. Prefer pointing to the guard as the
  source of truth instead of duplicating fragile counts.
- Every Build Queue item should state class (`DEFECT`, `DECISION`, `ENH`),
  scope, success criteria, validation/guard target, and any migration/PROD gate
  once it is promoted into an active lane.
- Remove or reconcile stale text instead of appending corrections nearby.
- Normal build/hotfix lanes must not edit this file unless Ronnie explicitly
  requests docs, wrap, or a named `PROJECT.md` change.

Design/function invariants that govern cross-surface behavior live in
`## Global Decisions (Constitution)` and `## Design System`.

---

## Current State

- Production deploy: Netlify auto-deploys from GitHub `main`. The latest product
  code is `5354a79`; this documentation-only wrap follows it without changing
  runtime code. The public `/processing` route and its `5354a79` production
  bundle were verified after deploy. There are no open GitHub pull requests at
  this wrap.
- Supabase live high-water: all repository migrations through `166` and
  `170`-`177` are PROD-applied; numbers `167`-`169` are intentionally unused.
  Current PROD Edge versions are `rapid-processor` v29,
  `processing-asana-sync` v11, `tasks-cron` v6, `tasks-summary` v8, and
  `newsletter-harvest` v6. TEST has `rapid-processor` v3 and
  `newsletter-harvest` v1; no TEST `processing-asana-sync` deploy exists.
- Newsletter live state: Autopilot + direction-first redesign + fact fixes +
  archive-link gating + the UX polish pass are merged. The polish pass adds
  debounced/autosaved admin direction, prevents local direction clobbering during
  refreshes, clarifies AI-vs-template/gather/fact workflow states, relabels
  newsletter runs, and brings the public reader into the WCF branded email
  family. Migrations `146`/`151`/`153` are PROD-applied; `newsletter-harvest` is
  deployed (PROD v6 / TEST v1); `NEWSLETTER_AI_API_KEY` is a PROD-only Edge
  Function secret (TEST intentionally unset); the monthly cron is off. The
  public archive is link-gated by a rotating `?key=`. See the Monthly Newsletter
  contract for behavior and Build Queue item 1 for the open first-issue /
  PROD-AI-smoke work. (Deploy version, secret presence, PROD migration apply,
  and published-issue/token counts are live state — see the live-verification
  note in the Supabase Migrations section.)
- Pasture Map live state: the pasture migrations `116`, `127`-`132`, `135`-`137`,
  `139`-`141`, `143`, `147`-`150`, `152`, `155`, and `158` are PROD-applied.
  Migration `158` fixes boundary-touch false resting/occupied states by requiring
  positive-area overlap for overlap impacts and read derivation; FP4C1/FP4E2
  re-read baseline while FP4D1 rests and FP4E1 is occupied. Migration `150`'s
  `NOTIFY pgrst` line is text-only for future/fresh-env applies and was NOT
  re-applied to PROD (the function body was already live/verified). `/pasture-map`
  is an installable PWA hub; the service-worker cache version is
  `2026-06-30-pasture-pwa-v1`. Light has pasture farm-team-level Map/Field access
  (migration `139`). See the Pasture Map contract for UI/behavior rules.
- Migration `143` remains deployed as a benign unused helper; no UI calls it.
- Production legacy import: `Processing Events - ALL.xlsx` upserted 69 rows into
  `production_legacy_events` on PROD by stable `source_key` (frozen historical
  count).
- Processing Calendar schema is PROD-applied through `177`; the live Edge is
  `processing-asana-sync` v11 (deployed with the planned-Pig matcher exclusion),
  `ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN` remains set, and `asana_sync_enabled` is still true. Current PROD inventory is 119 Processing
  records with statuses normalized to 67 `complete`, 1 `in_process`, and 51
  `planned`: 52 active `planner_batch`, 50 active `asana_historical`, 16
  archived `import_exception`, and 1 active milestone. There are 117 Asana links,
  110 attached to Processing records.
- Processing planner integration is shipped end-to-end. Migrations `175`-`177`
  rekeyed planner rows to immutable batch/trip identity, made planned Pig trips
  first-class Processing records, backfilled phase/ordinal/status/template step
  identity, normalized option lists, removed Processing subtask dates, widened
  notification checks, and added completion/workflow integration. PROD
  post-apply verification found 27/27 Broiler planner rows rekeyed, all 8 Pig
  rows source-phased, every active template step carrying a stable id, and the
  first reconcile under the new engine restamped 27 Broiler / 16 Cattle / 1 Sheep
  / 8 Pig rows with 0 removed and 0 retired. Brett Post name-only Processing
  assignments were silently corrected to Accounting and Isabel Hermann
  assignments to Isabel; post-check found 0 name-only remnants and 0
  notifications emitted.
- Processing artifacts already imported: 1,104 recursive Asana subtasks
  (798 complete / 306 open; 557 assigned; 537 with due dates; 380 with start
  dates), preserving imported completion state and local ownership rules.
  Processing has 129 imported Asana comments across 52 records. Conversation
  fidelity imported 8 comment-media files (about 20.4 MB) into private
  `processing-attachments`; those bytes render both on their original imported
  comments and in the record attachment index. B-26-04 is the representative
  proof: 9 subtasks (8 complete / 1 open) and Brian Naide's two JPG posts are
  present. Idempotent artifact/media reruns wrote no duplicates.
- Processing work intentionally not run: the last broad attachment dry run
  enumerated 67 Asana task attachments before the 8 conversation-media imports;
  a fresh dry run must establish the remaining-new count. Historical Activity
  import would add roughly 16,855 Asana system-story rows. Neither operation is
  exposed in the day-to-day UI; both remain explicit data-volume decisions in
  Build Queue item 2. Three deleted Asana cards linked to dismissed placeholders
  consistently 404 and are skipped without aborting a run.
- Processing UI is simplified and live. The former Admin/maintenance,
  reconciliation, historical-import controls, status/processor filters, Show
  archived checkbox, stale sort label, and per-section Add milestone rows are
  removed. Admins get a direct **Templates** button; the global **+ Add
  milestone** button remains at the top. Templates are local-only and contain
  inline Tasks/Fields editing plus Customer/Processor choice management. Customer
  and Processor are settings-backed single selects. Parent-record Assignee and
  the six retired fields (Farm, Planned Processing Date, Actual/Planned Time on
  Farm, Product Pickup Date, and Time Remaining) are absent from defaults and
  drawer. Checklist-step assignees remain supported. The four active template v2
  rows have 11/10/10/10 fields and preserve their 8/16/11/16-item checklists; v1
  rows remain inactive for history.
- Processing status labels are normalized to `Planned` / `In Process` / `Complete`
  via `src/lib/processingStatusDisplay.js` (display-only; stored values are
  unchanged). See the Processing Calendar contract for the mapping and the
  pig-specific zero-head exception.
- CP5 public webform island styling (`ceb7dcf`) is shipped in the static HTML
  shells (`index.html`, `dailys.html`, `equipment.html`, `pasture-map.html`).
  It updates the public `#webform-container` fallback/island form tokens and
  radii. The public `/dailys` and `/equipment` hubs now use a simplified header:
  no wheat icon or helper copy, a larger `WCF Planner` title, and that title
  links back to the main planner page.
- Cattle Herds and nutrition current state: `/cattle/herds` defaults to grouped,
  collapsible herd tiles when no filters/search/non-default sort are active. Any
  active filter/search/non-default sort switches to one flat matched-results
  table. The `Sold` herd filter is sold-only and flat (no Processed/Deceased/Sold
  section headers). `Last Activity` sort/column uses the cattle animal Activity
  stream and shows date/time; the record-page Herd dropdown routes through the
  audited transfer RPC. The cattle nutrition dashboard now calculates `DM lb/day`
  from true dry matter (as-fed pounds less feed-line moisture); CP and NFC are
  computed from the nutrition snapshot percentages against that dry matter. The
  standalone cattle nutrition audit HTML was updated with the dry-matter
  correction.
- Home materials-needed hotfix: clearing one material in an equipment service
  interval preserves service-interval grouping/order, so later interval materials
  no longer jump to the bottom and look deleted.
- Mutation audit current state: PR1 (`0b424cb`) routes the sheep record-page
  Flock dropdown through `transfer_sheep_animal`; PR2A (`efe9483`) adds
  best-effort Activity emits across live cattle, pig, weigh-in/webform,
  equipment, and processing-attach surfaces; PR2B (`d169757`) adds the remaining
  summary emits and the dedicated `equipment.fuel_bill` Activity entity via
  migration `154`. Migration `170` now routes cattle/sheep detach workflows
  through audited atomic RPCs and safely admits program-authorized `farm_team`;
  migration `171` routes UsersModal profile mutations through admin-only audited
  RPCs and gives `rapid-processor` v29 the guarded Auth hard-delete handler.
  Accounts retained by farm-record foreign keys still cannot be hard-deleted and
  must be deactivated. Historical Activity backfill remains unapproved.
  User-management residual verification/scope decisions are Build Queue item 4;
  the remaining processing lock-order hardening is item 5.
- `tasks-cron` Edge Function is active in PROD: recurring + system-task generation
  with batch/group entity labels, plus To Do approval/originator notifications.
- Broiler derived-data drift lane is closed and verified in PROD.
- Dependency hardening is complete: Vite/Vitest/plugin-react majors upgraded,
  SheetJS pinned to the patched 0.20.3 tarball, Node pinned to 22 for Netlify, and
  `npm audit` is 0 on the hardened lockfile.
- Validation baseline at the shipped checkpoint: Prettier passes (the former
  three-file drift was fixed by `c38a07c`), lint has 0 errors, 296 Vitest files /
  7,156 tests pass (re-verified on `5354a79` at this wrap), production build
  passes, migration `175`-`177` TEST apply
  proofs passed 32/32 checks, and the migrated-TEST Processing Playwright suite
  passed `processing_calendar` 11/11, `processing_planner_lifecycle` 3/3, and
  `processing_my_tasks` 4/4. The GitHub whole-app Playwright step previously
  exceeded the workflow's 30-minute budget; CI segmentation/runtime remains an
  explicit defect in Build Queue item 6 rather than a product-test success.
- Worktree inventory at wrap start: `C:/Users/Ronni/WCF-planner-main-release`
  was the clean `main`/`origin/main` release worktree at `5354a79`; this wrap
  changes only `PROJECT.md`. Seven clean merged/superseded satellite worktrees
  were pruned during wrap: detach, materials-needed-order, public-hub-link,
  user-management-audit, customer-fields, planner-integration, and template
  suite. Remaining registered worktrees are the primary
  `C:/Users/Ronni/WCF-planner` on merged `feature/processing-ui-simplify`, CC2's
  unmerged CI branch `C:/Users/Ronni/WCF-planner-cc2-ci`, dirty draft
  `C:/Users/Ronni/WCF-planner-codex-user-management-residuals`, dirty draft
  `C:/Users/Ronni/WCF-planner-codex-validation`, and this clean main-release
  worktree. The now-unregistered
  `C:/Users/Ronni/WCF-planner-codex-user-management` folder is empty but locked
  by Windows; delete it manually after the owning process/window releases it.
  Stashes dated 2026-07-10 for template-suite and customer-field drafts are
  obsolete/superseded and must not be applied over current `main`. Two more
  stashes exist on `main`: a superseded parallel `PROJECT.md` wrap draft
  (obsolete — the real wrap landed as this commit) and June-era untracked
  daily-hub screenshot leftovers (harmless, recoverable). All four stashes are
  prune candidates pending Ronnie's approval.

### Recent Shipped Checkpoints

Per-PR shipped history is not maintained here. For what shipped and when, read
`git log` (every checkpoint hash resolves there) and `archive/SESSION_LOG.md`.
Durable behavior lives in the Load-Bearing Contracts below; current migration and
live state lives in Current State and Backend And Data State.

Most recent session: Processing planner integration (`522e448`), public hub
header/link polish (`037693d`/`2f87380`/`58973d8`), Processing template/schedule
UI hotfixes (`312fce8` through `5354a79`), and the `175`-`177` PROD migration +
Edge deploy/correction bundle. Earlier durable checkpoints remain in `git log`.

---

## Build Queue

Treat these as product lanes, not hotfixes, unless Ronnie says otherwise.
This is the canonical home for outstanding build/design work.

1. Newsletter first production issue + PROD AI smoke
   - Status: PRODUCT/SQL/EDGE RELEASED; FIRST REAL ISSUE WORKFLOW NOT YET RUN.
     Newsletter Autopilot, direction-first editing, archive-link gating, and
     `newsletter-harvest` PROD v6 are live. `NEWSLETTER_AI_API_KEY` is a
     PROD-only Edge secret; TEST intentionally has no key. Cron remains off.
   - Class: `ENH`/`AI`/`DATA-OPERATION`.
   - Remaining actions:
     - Confirm `aiConfigured: true` through an approved PROD admin probe.
     - Gather/re-gather the first issue, review coverage and numbers, write or
       rewrite the draft, approve/place photos, preview, and publish.
     - Generate or confirm the rotating archive key, then verify the link-gated
       public `/newsletter` result.
     - Keep monthly cron off until Ronnie separately approves automation.
   - Success criteria: one reviewed real issue is published, the keyed public
     archive works, source coverage/numbers are checked, and no private or
     unapproved media is exposed.

2. Processing remaining artifact volume and final Asana cutover
   - Status: CORE IMPORT COMPLETE; THREE EXPLICIT DATA DECISIONS REMAIN. Planner
     reconcile, manual crosswalk resolution, 1,104 subtasks, 129 comments, and 8
     conversation-media files are live. Canonical local v2 templates are active;
     Asana template import is no longer part of the product UI or required.
   - Class: `DECISION`/`DATA-IMPORT`/`STORAGE`/`CUTOVER`.
   - Decisions:
     - Ordinary attachment backfill: the last broad dry run enumerated 67 Asana
       task attachments before the 8 conversation-media imports. Re-run the dry
       plan to establish new/already-stored counts; expect the three known
       deleted-card 404 skips. Apply only with explicit volume/storage approval,
       then prove idempotence and representative signed URLs.
     - Historical Activity: the dry run found about 16,855 Asana system stories.
       Default recommendation is to keep the Planner history lean and leave
       these unimported unless Ronnie explicitly wants field-churn history.
     - Final cutover: after the two decisions above, optionally set
       `asana_sync_enabled=false` through its separate gate. Do not infer this
       from removal of the historical-import UI.
   - Success criteria: each decision is recorded; any approved import has zero
     duplicate writes on rerun and representative Broiler/Cattle/Pig/Sheep
     checks; final cutover occurs only after explicit approval.

3. Processing post-integration polish and stale Pig test debt
   - Status: SMALL FOLLOW-UP AFTER SHIPPED PLANNER INTEGRATION. The main
     Processing planner integration is live through migration `177`; this item is
     only for residual copy/test cleanup.
   - Class: `DEFECT`/`UX`/`TEST`.
   - Scope:
     - Update `PigSendToTripModal` preview copy for under-send remainder handling:
       the server now moves the remainder to a new/next planned trip; copy must
       not say it stays on the original planned trip.
     - Repair or retire stale `tests/pig_send_to_planned_trip.spec.js`, which
       still references dead UI strings such as `Select all unsent`. Keep any
       replacement aligned with the current per-row checkbox and Send-to-Trip bar.
   - Validation: focused Pig send-to-trip unit/static coverage plus the repaired
     Playwright spec if retained.

4. User-management residual verification and audit-scope decisions
   - Status: CORE HARDENING SHIPPED. Migration `171`, audited UsersModal RPCs,
     immutable `user_management_audit`, and the `rapid-processor` v29 delete
     handler are live. Retained farm-record foreign keys intentionally refuse
     hard delete; deactivate those accounts instead.
   - Class: `SECURITY`/`TEST`/`DECISION`/`DEFECT`.
   - Remaining work:
     - Invoke the real TEST Edge handler (not a browser mock) for successful
       delete, retained-FK refusal, and terminal reconciliation.
     - Decide whether user creation and password-reset actions belong in the
       audit ledger; current `171` scope covers profile edits, activation,
       program access, and hard-delete lifecycle.
     - Replace UsersModal's single global `userActionId` with deterministic
       multi-row/global mutation locking so concurrent row actions cannot
       re-enable controls early or overwrite notices.
     - Decide whether service-role/support misuse of a pending delete request
       must be guarded beyond the current browser/RPC threat model.
   - Gate: any SQL/RPC/Edge change needs focused TEST proof and a separate PROD
     migration/function-deploy approval.

5. Processing lifecycle lock-order hardening
   - Status: KNOWN CONCURRENCY FOLLOW-UP. Migration `170` aligns cattle/sheep
     attach/detach on batch -> matching weigh-ins -> animal with membership
     revalidation. Migration `100`'s sheep batch delete still locks animal rows
     before the batch and was explicitly excluded from that lane.
   - Class: `DEFECT`/`CONCURRENCY`/`DB-GATE`.
   - Scope: inventory every processing lifecycle RPC, choose one compatible lock
     order, reissue only conflicting functions, and prove concurrent attach,
     detach, and delete cannot deadlock or restore stale detail lists.
   - Gate: TEST concurrency/RPC proof first; PROD SQL only after explicit
     approval. Do not change role gates or lifecycle semantics incidentally.

6. CI whole-app Playwright runtime
   - Status: DEFECT. The `029899c` main workflow passed change detection,
     install, formatting, lint, all Vitest tests, and production build, then the
     serialized whole-app Playwright step exceeded the 30-minute job budget and
     was cancelled. Several preceding main runs show the same timeout pattern.
     CC2 has an unmerged draft branch/worktree at
     `feature/ci-playwright-runtime-cc2` / `C:/Users/Ronni/WCF-planner-cc2-ci`
     (`e277a3b`) that splits serialized Playwright runtime across shards; verify
     and merge only after review.
   - Class: `DEFECT`/`CI`/`TEST-INFRA`.
   - Scope: profile spec/runtime cost, split or path-gate independent suites
     without racing the shared TEST database, preserve workers=1 for reset-heavy
     specs, and retain failure artifacts.
   - Success criteria: at least two consecutive representative main runs finish
     with a real success/failure conclusion inside the configured budget; no
     suite is silently dropped.

## Global Decisions (Constitution)

The following decisions are locked and govern future builds. New code and
surface changes MUST conform unless this section is amended.

Rules:

- No surface may silently diverge from a locked decision. New exceptions MUST be
  added to `## Intentional Non-Uniformities` with justification.
- Changing any locked decision requires a Ronnie-approved amendment in this file
  and the relevant guard update in the same change.
- The entire `## Design System` section is part of the Constitution.

| Universal hover affordance (CP0 WI-6) | tile/card openables lift 3px/300ms + trailing chevron; table rows signal via wash + cell-border + chevron without `<tr>` transform; daily record lists use div-based `.hoverable-tile` cards to get the Home-tile lift | `openable_hover_affordance_static.test.js` |

Locked functional invariants:

## Intentional Non-Uniformities

These differences are current product/architecture decisions, not parity defects
unless Ronnie changes the contract:

- Light users are intentionally excluded from `/weighins` and `/production`.
  Light users have pasture farm-team-level access to `/pasture-map` (migration
  `139`): full Map + Field working controls, not a read-only/Map-only view.
- Light users may access Cattle Log through the webform/field-journal path.
- Migration `083` public webform submitter identity stays shelved. Authenticated
  submitter identity is the durable path.
- `/webform-pigs` remains a valid legacy standalone pig daily form route/alias.
- `egg_dailys` has warning/pre-submit duplicate prevention only; it is not
  covered by the daily unique-index backstop.
- Add Feed quick-log rows are not full daily reports, and missed-report checks
  exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Broiler, layer, and pig daily pages use Group copy rather than Batch copy.
- Pig planned-trip forecast weights are render-only. Latest weigh-ins do not
  change planned-trip forecast weights automatically.
- Program dashboards may show program-specific KPIs.
- The public `#webform-container` CSS island is intentionally separate from the
  React app tokens.
- The homepage redesign remains scoped under `.home.theme-crisp`; do not move
  Home-specific non-canonical micro-values globally without an amendment.
- The public `#webform-container` island has its CP5 form-styling pass in the
  static HTML shells (`ceb7dcf`). That pass affects the fallback/island surface,
  not authenticated React routes rendered through `#root`.
- CP0 section A12.1 permitted-uses are extended (2026-06-17) so the primary/brand button
  re-tints to the program color via `--brand` on each program's page wrapper; this
  is ratified, not palette drift.
- `getReadableText()` in `src/lib/styles.js` returns infrastructure contrast
  colors for arbitrary colored backgrounds; this is not palette drift.

## Product Surface

### Authenticated App

- Home dashboard: `.home.theme-crisp` landing surface with label-only program
  tiles, Pasture Map + Weather field row, Processing/Admin utility row, Animals
  on Farm, Production, missed-daily/equipment/material alerts, Next 30 Days, and
  admin Last-5-Days.
- `/animals-on-farm`: newest-first monthly species counts and multi-series line
  graph for Broilers, Layer Hens, Pigs, Cattle, Sheep, and Total. History range
  starts Oct 2024.
- `/production`: per-program production totals, per-program YoY, and production
  events. Internal reconciliation prevents double-counting historical backfill,
  but the visible page is production reporting, not audit/import review. No
  combined total ever.
- `/pasture-map`: field map/planning surface for OnX KML import, land-area
  review, classification, outline close, draw/edit/snap/measure, acreage
  display, GPS locate, NAIP imagery, move ledger/current occupancy, planned
  moves, rest/history/stocking reports, offline vector queue, GPS field tracks,
  and line-style/pattern controls.
- Broiler: home, timeline, batches, feed, dailys, weigh-ins.
- Pig: home, breeding, farrowing, breeding pigs, batches, feed, dailys,
  weigh-ins with table-based session records and Active/Complete list sections.
- Layer: home, groups, batches, dailys, eggs.
- Cattle: home, herds, breeding, forecast, processing batches, dailys,
  weigh-ins, Cattle Log.
- Sheep: home, flocks, processing batches, dailys, weigh-ins.
- Equipment/Fleet: `/fleet` with fleet list, fuel log, and equipment detail;
  `/equipment` remains the login-gated fueling/checklist hub.
- Task Center: `/tasks`, with To Do List at `/tasks/todo` and record pages at
  `/tasks/todo/<id>`.
- Light portal: contained home for `role=light`, allowed webform/daily
  shortcuts, Tasks, My Submissions/View Past Reports, equipment public hub, fuel
  supply, Add Feed, legacy pig daily, Cattle Log, and pasture farm-team-level
  Pasture Map (full Map + Field working controls, migration `139`). No Production
  or Weigh-ins.
- Global Activity: `/activity`.
- Admin/config: `/admin`.
- Admin runtime observability: `/admin/client-errors`.

### Login-Gated Form URLs

- Former public report/form URLs are authenticated. Existing paths and aliases
  stay valid, redirect logged-out users to login, and return to the requested URL
  after auth.
- `/dailys` and `/dailys/tasks`.
- `/addfeed`.
- `/weighins`.
- `/equipment` and `/equipment/<slug>`.
- `/fuel-supply`.
- `/webform-pigs`.
- Legacy aliases redirect through `src/lib/routes.js`.

### Operational Record Pages

Record pages are durable per-entity workspaces. They own record details,
Comments, collapsed Activity log, sequence navigation where appropriate, and
fail-closed loading.

Live Activity entity types and routes:

| Entity type | Route |
| --- | --- |
| `task.instance` | `/tasks/<id>` |
| `todo.item` | `/tasks/todo/<id>` |
| `cattle.animal` | `/cattle/herds/<id>` |
| `sheep.animal` | `/sheep/flocks/<id>` |
| `cattle.processing` | `/cattle/batches/<id>` |
| `sheep.processing` | `/sheep/batches/<id>` |
| `broiler.batch` | `/broiler/batches/<encoded name>` |
| `pig.batch` | `/pig/batches/<group id>` |
| `pig.breeder` | `/pig/sows/<id>` |
| `layer.batch` | `/layer/batches/<id>` |
| `layer.housing` | `/layer/housings/<id>` |
| `equipment.item` | `/fleet/<id>` |
| `poultry.daily` | `/broiler/dailys/<id>` |
| `layer.daily` | `/layer/dailys/<id>` |
| `egg.daily` | `/layer/eggs/<id>` |
| `pig.daily` | `/pig/dailys/<id>` |
| `cattle.daily` | `/cattle/dailys/<id>` |
| `sheep.daily` | `/sheep/dailys/<id>` |
| `weighin.session` | `/weigh-in-sessions/<id>` |
| `cattle.forecast` | `/cattle/forecast` |
| `cattle.breeding` | `/cattle/breeding` |
| `cattle.log` | `/cattle/log` |

No operational record workspace should reintroduce legacy `ActivityPanel` or
`ActivityModal`. Comments are discussion; Activity is audit/history.

## Backend And Data State

### Stack

- React 18 / Vite SPA.
- Supabase JS client from `src/lib/supabase.js` only.
- React Router DOM.
- `idb` for IndexedDB/offline queue.
- Leaflet for Pasture Map rendering; Leaflet-Geoman powers draw/edit/snap
  controls.
- Vitest for unit/static tests.
- Playwright for e2e.
- ESLint + Prettier.
- Netlify production deploy from `main`.
- Netlify Functions (serverless): the Home Weather data proxy
  (`netlify/functions/weather-forecast.js`).

### Supabase Migrations

Current PROD architecture includes all repository migrations through `166` and
`170` through `177`; `167`-`169` are intentionally unused. Recent load-bearing
migrations:

- `100` processing batch lifecycle RPCs.
- `101`-`104` audited delete RPCs and hardening.
- `105` recurring task template creation RPC.
- `106` delete layer batch RPC.
- `107` delete fuel bill RPC.
- `108` delete feed input RPC.
- `109` drop dead daily-photo anon insert policy.
- `110` cattle calf-row heifer promotion.
- `111` weigh-in note -> canonical comment mirror.
- `112` cattle log sidecar tables/RPCs/triggers.
- `113` Light daily report 3-day own-record edit/delete window.
- `114` task photo 5-total DB backstop.
- `115` Task Center To Do List schema/RPCs/photos/mentions/digest fields.
- `116` Pasture Map CP1:
  - `pasture_import_batches`, self-referencing `land_areas`, and append-only
    `land_area_geometry_versions`.
  - PostGIS in `extensions` schema; geometry stored as 4326; acreage via
    `ST_Area(geom::geography)`.
  - Deny-all RLS; access only through SECURITY DEFINER RPCs.
  - `list_land_areas` read gate originally: `farm_team`, `management`, `admin`;
    migration `136` widens only this read RPC and `list_pasture_moves` to Light.
  - Import/classify/close/delete gates: `management`, `admin`.
  - OnX UUID becomes `source_external_id`; re-import updates, not duplicates.
  - Polygons import as `unclassified`/`pending_review`; LineStrings import as
    `outline_candidate`; no auto-close; invalid polygons are flagged, not fixed.
  - No fabricated last-grazed date; `baseline_no_history` is distinct.
- `125` Production legacy events:
  - `production_legacy_events` table with deny-all RLS.
  - `list_production_legacy_events(date,date)` SECURITY DEFINER read RPC.
  - Read gate: `farm_team`, `management`, `admin`; Light excluded.
  - Spreadsheet importer upserts by stable `source_key`; 69 rows imported to
    PROD on 2026-06-15.
- `126` Breeding-pig Activity entity:
  - Adds `pig.breeder` to `_activity_can_read` / `_activity_can_write`.
  - Existence check is `app_store` key `ppp-breeders-v1`, object id match.
  - Program access gate is `pig`.
- `127` Pasture Map CP2 draw/edit:
  - Adds `create_land_area(text,text,jsonb,text,text)` and
    `update_land_area_geometry(text,jsonb)` SECURITY DEFINER RPCs.
  - Management/admin only; EXECUTE granted to `authenticated` and revoked from
    `PUBLIC`/`anon`.
  - Reuses `_land_area_add_version`; edits append a new geometry version and
    stamp version source as `drawn`, while preserving the original area source
    in raw payload.
  - Validates polygon/multipolygon GeoJSON and rejects invalid/self-
    intersecting geometry; acreage remains geodesic.
  - PROD-applied on 2026-06-16 with schema reload and structural/PostgREST anon
    permission smokes. No PROD land-area rows were created.
- `128` Pasture Map CP3 move ledger / occupancy / rest:
  - Adds `pasture_move_events`, `pasture_move_impacts`,
    `_land_area_current_geom`, `_pasture_move_summary`, updated
    `_land_area_summary`, `list_pasture_moves`, and `record_pasture_move`.
  - Move impacts track destination/departure/overlap. Grazing state and current
    occupants are derived from dated move events.
- `129` Pasture Map CP4 planning/reports:
  - Adds `pasture_planned_moves`, planned-move create/list/status RPCs, and
    history/rest/stocking report RPCs.
- `130` Pasture Map CP6 field GPS tracks:
  - Adds `create_land_area_track` for farm-team/management/admin field-created
    outline candidates from GPS LineStrings.
- `131` Pasture Map CP7 line style:
  - Adds line color/weight support and manager/admin style update RPCs.
- `132` Pasture Map line patterns/defaults:
  - Adds `line_pattern`, solid/dashed/dotted validation, default imported OnX
    line styling, default field-track styling, and
    `update_land_area_line_style`.
  - Verified TEST and PROD artifacts present on 2026-06-17 by catalog checks.
- `133` task system generation support and To Do approval notifications:
  - Widens `notifications_type_check` for `todo_completion_submitted`.
  - Reissues `submit_todo_completion` so non-manager completion submissions
    notify management/admin while approval and auto-approval still notify the
    To Do creator.
  - TEST-applied on 2026-06-17; PROD-applied on 2026-06-18.
- `134` originator task/to-do edit photos:
  - Preserves RPC-only writes, append-only private photo storage, and the shared
    5-photo total cap.
  - PROD-applied on 2026-06-18.
- `135` Pasture Map temp-paddock lifecycle:
  - Adds narrow SECURITY DEFINER RPCs for real temp paddock create/rename/redraw,
    archive/restore, and admin hard-delete using `kind='paddock'` plus
    `permanence='temporary'`; existing permanent-area create/update/delete RPCs
    remain management/admin locked.
  - TEST- and PROD-applied/verified. Production temp-paddock lifecycle calls are
    supported.
- `136` Pasture Map Light read-only Map access:
  - CREATE OR REPLACEs only `list_land_areas(boolean)` and
    `list_pasture_moves(int)` to add `light` to those read gates.
  - Does not widen write, planning, rest, stocking, or history report RPCs.
  - TEST-applied by CC and PROD-applied by Codex on 2026-06-20 with
    `psql --single-transaction`; PostgREST schema reload was notified.
  - PROD verification confirmed the two read RPCs contain the Light gate and
    `record_pasture_move`, planned-move, rest, stocking, and history RPCs do not
    contain Light.
- `137` Pasture feeder-pig paddock destinations:
  - Adds the feeder-pig paddock destination support used by the current
    Pasture Map production code.
  - PROD-applied before the 2026-06-24 wrap.
- `138` Tier-1 RLS anon write-boundary hardening:
  - Drops legacy anon/public write policies on targeted daily/weigh-in/comment
    write tables while preserving authenticated `*_auth_all` policies.
  - PROD-applied and verified: zero targeted `*_anon_*` policies remain; five
    authenticated policies remain.
- `139`-`141` Pasture Map V1 reset:
  - `139_pasture_map_light_farm_team.sql` widens pasture-only Light permissions
    to the farm-team-level pasture RPC set. It does not widen Light outside
    Pasture Map.
  - `140_pasture_map_rotations.sql` adds server-backed manual rotation paths.
  - `141_pasture_map_measurements.sql` adds saved distance-measurement layers.
  - PROD-applied and verified on 2026-06-24.
- `142` System task title entity labels:
  - Adds optional `p_entity_label` to `generate_system_task_instance`, backfills
    open system task titles, and supports the corresponding `tasks-cron` deploy.
  - PROD-applied and verified on 2026-06-24; `tasks-cron` was deployed after the
    migration.
- `143` Pasture Map reset-area-grazing-history:
  - `delete_land_area_grazing_history(p_id text)` SECDEF, management/admin gated.
    Clears one area's `pasture_move_impacts` and detaches it from every
    `pasture_move_events` from/to, then resets `baseline_no_history` so state
    re-derives to "no move history". Other areas' impacts are preserved.
  - PROD-applied + verified 2026-06-25. The UI button and client wrapper that
    called it are removed; the RPC stays deployed but unused. Append-only ledger
    background lives in the Pasture Map Load-Bearing Contract below.
- `144` Newsletter Engine data/RPC boundary:
  - Adds tables: `newsletter_issues`, `newsletter_fact_candidates`,
    `newsletter_photos`, `newsletter_runs`, and `newsletter_settings`.
  - Deny-all RLS; admin-only SECDEF RPCs for issue/intake/fact/photo/settings
    management; exactly three anon read RPCs for published list, published issue,
    and token-gated preview.
  - Public payloads use structured JSON blocks and approved photo paths only;
    no raw AI HTML and no `source_private_path` exposure.
  - Preview tokens are enabled/expiring, rotate on publish/unpublish/regenerate,
    and publish disables pre-publication preview links. Anon `noindex` is
    literal/locked true. Month inputs validate strict calendar `YYYY-MM`.
  - PROD catalog verified 2026-06-26: all five tables exist with RLS enabled;
    anon EXECUTE is present only on `list_published_newsletters`,
    `get_published_newsletter`, and `get_newsletter_preview` among the sampled
    newsletter RPCs.
- `145` Newsletter storage buckets:
  - Private `newsletter-staging` bucket: admin-only read/write for uploads and
    copied planner photos before public consent.
  - Public `newsletter-public` bucket: public read, admin-only write, populated
    only after admin photo approval; unapprove deletes the public copy.
  - PROD catalog verified 2026-06-26: `newsletter-staging` exists with
    `public=false`; `newsletter-public` exists with `public=true`.
- `146` Newsletter automation:
  - Adds the earlier Checkpoint B automation layer for
    `newsletter-harvest`, monthly reminder/task support, AI/template draft
    persistence, run logging, and a gated cron-invocation RPC.
  - PROD-applied + verified on 2026-06-29 as Gate 1 for PR #44, immediately
    before migration `151`. The monthly cron schedule remains intentionally off.
- `147` Pasture Map grazing entry delete and parent overlap:
  - Adds `delete_pasture_move(p_move_id)` SECDEF, management/admin gated,
    authenticated EXECUTE only, anon denied.
  - Per-stay delete removes the selected move and cascades its impacts. If the
    deleted move has a later move for the same animal group, the RPC clears only
    that later move's linked departure impacts for the touched areas and
    preserves the later move event. This prevents completed-stay drift.
  - `_land_area_summary` suppresses child-derived overlap state for direct
    parent pastures, so child paddock occupancy/rest does not color the parent
    fill. Parent-only history now resolves to baseline instead of visible
    no-history fill when appropriate.
  - TEST behavior and PROD catalog were verified on 2026-06-26.
- `148` Pasture Map group records, actual-weight metrics, planned cleanup:
  - Adds `pasture_move_events.total_weight_lbs` with a positive-value check and
    updates move/report RPCs to expose actual move-time group weight.
  - Updates `record_pasture_move` to accept optional `p_total_weight_lbs`;
    pasture group history/stay metrics use only recorded data for lbs/ac.
  - Drops the unused `pasture_planned_moves` table and planned-move RPCs. The
    rotation editor is now the planning source, and the group record move box
    records current area to next rotation area.
  - PROD smoke verified on 2026-06-26: weight column exists, record-move weight
    signature exists, and `pasture_planned_moves` is absent.
- `149` Pasture Map rest/history reconciliation:
  - Replaces `_land_area_summary` so orphan `pasture_move_impacts` whose move
    event has NULL `to_land_area_id`/`from_land_area_id` no longer derive
    occupancy, last touch, or resting state. This resolves the FP3/FP3A1 defect
    where the Map showed "Resting/Last grazed" while Reports showed no visible
    direct stay.
  - Preserves migration `147` child-from-parent suppression and does not change
    schema, RLS, grants, or return shape. Stale orphan impact rows are ignored,
    not deleted.
  - PROD-applied + verified 2026-06-27: FP3 and FP3A1 returned to baseline;
    Pig Pasture #4 remained occupied as positive control.
- `150` Pasture Map open-line edit:
  - Adds `update_land_area_track(p_id text, p_line_geojson jsonb)` SECDEF,
    management/admin gated, authenticated/service/postgres EXECUTE only and no
    anon/PUBLIC grant.
  - Validates LineString/MultiLineString with at least two points, allows only
    existing `outline_candidate` targets, rewrites `land_areas.raw_geometry` in
    place, and intentionally writes no acreage, geometry version, promotion, or
    schema/RLS/grant/return-shape change.
  - PROD-applied + verified 2026-06-27. PostgREST schema reload was issued
    manually after apply because this is a new exposed RPC. PR #45 later added
    `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'` to the migration file for future/fresh-env
    applies only; the migration was not re-applied to PROD because the function
    body was already live/verified.
- `151` Newsletter Autopilot:
  - Extends newsletter settings/issues for tone, length/detail, source
    coverage, photo plan, photo targets/minimums, and past-issue context;
    updates settings/generation input/admin/service RPCs; preserves mig `144`'s
    exactly-three anon RPC surface.
  - PROD-applied + verified on 2026-06-29 immediately after `146`. Verification
    covered the `146` RPC surface, the `151` RPC/settings/photo-plan additions,
    and the single backward-compatible `update_newsletter_settings` overload.
    `newsletter-harvest` was redeployed after the SQL gate (v2 at this
    mig-151/PR #44 checkpoint — see Current State for the current active version);
    the PROD-only `NEWSLETTER_AI_API_KEY` secret is live, so AI calls can use
    Anthropic in production. TEST intentionally remains without that key.
- `152` Pasture Map manager hard delete:
  - Widens `hard_delete_land_area` from admin-only to management+admin, keeping
    the occupancy guard, child-detach, and no-purge soft-delete path unchanged;
    the client danger zone + Area-record gate moved to `isManager`.
  - Applied to TEST and PROD on 2026-06-30 with the role gate, grants, occupancy
    guard, and no-purge path verified on PROD.
- `153` Newsletter archive-link gating:
  - Adds `archive_access_token` + `archive_access_expires_at` to
    `newsletter_settings`; key-gates the two published-archive anon RPCs
    (`list_published_newsletters`, `get_published_newsletter` gain `p_key` and
    return NULL unless the key matches + is unexpired, constant-time compare via
    `_newsletter_archive_key_ok`); `publish_newsletter_issue` mints a fresh 7-day
    key; adds the admin-only `regenerate_newsletter_archive_link`; and surfaces
    the key + expiry through `get_newsletter_settings`. Anon surface stays the
    same three RPCs (`get_newsletter_preview` unchanged). No BEGIN/COMMIT in the
    file (exec_sql / `psql --single-transaction` wrap it).
  - TEST-applied + behaviorally verified via `scripts/apply_test_mig_153.cjs`
    (locked w/ no/wrong/expired key; valid key works; admin-only regenerate kills
    the old key). PROD-applied + verified 2026-06-30 via
    `psql --single-transaction -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1` with a behavioral check;
    PostgREST reloaded via the file's `NOTIFY pgrst`. No Edge Function or Netlify
    env change. Reverses the prior "public no-login archive" contract.
- `154` Fuel-bill Activity entity / mutation-audit PR2B:
  - Adds dedicated `equipment.fuel_bill` Activity read/write scope by reissuing
    `_activity_can_read`; admin-only and existence-free so deleted fuel-bill
    tombstones remain readable.
  - Re-scopes `delete_fuel_bill` Activity from `equipment.item` to
    `equipment.fuel_bill`; `_activity_can_write` remains delegated to read.
  - TEST-applied and behaviorally verified by `scripts/apply_test_mig_154.cjs`;
    PROD-applied and verified after `d169757`.
- `155` Pasture Map departed-overlap rest fix:
  - Reissues `_land_area_is_occupied` / summary behavior so an area departed in
    the same move that created an overlap can rest correctly instead of staying
    zero-days/occupied.
  - No data mutation; PROD-applied as part of the pasture rested-paddock hotfix.
- `156` Processing Calendar foundation:
  - Adds the native Processing domain tables/RPC boundary, including records,
    subtasks, comments, attachments, templates/settings/import support, storage
    plumbing, `processing.record` Activity scope, and the initial
    `processing-asana-sync` Edge Function contract.
  - PROD-applied before the reconciler lane. Planner reconciliation, review
    resolution, comments, subtasks, and conversation-media imports have run;
    ordinary attachment/history volume and final cutover remain Build Queue
    item 2 decisions.
- `157` Processing Planner reconciler + Asana link table:
  - Adds `processing_asana_links`, imported comment provenance, subtask local
    ownership, drift/ack fields, reconciliation reports, planner enumeration,
    stale planner-row archival/unarchive, and the guarded Asana attach/import
    RPC contract.
  - `upsert_processing_from_asana` cannot mint `planner_batch`; Asana can only
    link/seed allowed provenance and artifacts. Manual crosswalks are sticky.
  - PROD-applied and catalog-verified. Planner reconcile, the retired workbench,
    comments, subtasks, and conversation-media lanes have run; see Current State
    and Build Queue item 2 for live counts and remaining decisions.
- `158` Pasture Map positive-area overlap impacts:
  - Reissues the pasture overlap predicate and affected move/read functions so a
    shared boundary/edge touch no longer counts as grazing overlap. Overlap
    state now requires positive geodesic intersection area (`> 1.0 m^2`) while
    still allowing true containment/real overlap.
  - PROD-applied and verified after the FP4D1 -> FP4E1 Mommas move defect:
    FP4D1 reads resting, FP4E1 occupied, and edge-touch neighbours FP4C1/FP4E2
    read baseline without data cleanup.
- `159` Processing reconciliation workbench:
  - Reissues/extends `resolve_processing_asana_link` so reassigning a link off a
    sole-owned Asana placeholder reparents comments/subtasks/attachments and
    archives the emptied placeholder.
  - Adds `triage_processing_asana_record`,
    `supersede_processing_asana_duplicate`, and an enriched
    `list_processing_reconciliation` with buckets, duplicate groups, candidates,
    dismissed rows, and duplicate-blocked provenance.
  - PROD-applied and verified; the client workbench and `sync_review_queue`
    action were deployed in the follow-on Edge gate, and Ronnie completed the
    reconciliation pass.
- `160` Processing broiler Time-on-Farm:
  - Reissues `list_processing_records` and `get_processing_record` to include
    `time_on_farm_days` for broiler `planner_batch` rows, derived read-only from
    `app_store` `ppp-v4` as `processingDate - hatchDate`.
  - PROD-applied and verified against live broiler planner rows. Migration `174`
    retired Time-on-Farm from the visible default suite/drawer; the read-only
    server value remains backward-compatible data, not an active UI field.
- `161` Processing soft archive RPC:
  - Adds `archive_processing_record(p_id text, p_archived boolean default true)`
    for Asana-owned/historical Processing rows. It preserves the record and any
    Asana links, supports restore, and refuses `planner_batch` rows because
    Planner-owned records are reconcile-managed.
  - PROD-applied and catalog-verified. Milestone hard delete remains separate.
- `162` Processing option lists:
  - Adds `customer_options` to the `processing_asana_sync_settings` singleton
    and wires the already-existing `processor_options` list into the UI.
  - Adds admin-only `set_processing_option_list(kind, options)`, which trims,
    de-dupes, drops blanks, and never rewrites stored Processing record values.
    Legacy/off-list customer/processor values remain valid and visible.
  - PROD-applied and verified; Customer/Processor choice management is live
    inside the admin-only Templates modal.
- `163` Processing attachments Storage bucket:
  - Creates the private `processing-attachments` bucket. SELECT on
    `storage.objects` is limited to authenticated operational roles
    (`farm_team`, `management`, `admin`) through `public.profile_role()`;
    `light`, `equipment_tech`, inactive users, and anon have no read. There is
    no authenticated INSERT policy at this migration checkpoint; Asana byte-copy
    writes are service-role importer work only.
  - PROD-applied and verified. Migration `166` later adds a narrow native-upload
    INSERT policy without opening the Asana namespace. Eight imported
    conversation-media objects are currently stored; ordinary attachment
    backfill remains a Build Queue item 2 decision.
- `164` Processing engine:
  - Adds typed template field storage, profile-backed checklist assignees,
    automatic planner freshness, template checklist seeding for new Planner
    records, reordering, and best-effort Activity emits for Processing-owned
    mutations. Reserved Planner/RPC-owned field ids remain server-refused.
  - PROD-applied and TEST-proven. The parent-record assignee RPC remains deployed
    for compatibility, but the simplified UI no longer exposes parent Assignee.
- `165` Processing import history and ownership:
  - Adds deterministic immutable Asana system-story Activity import, display-only
    mention mapping for imported comments, and profile mapping for imported
    record/checklist assignees while preserving local completion/assignment.
  - PROD-applied. Subtask/mention support is live; the roughly 16,855-row system-
    story Activity import has not run and is a Build Queue item 2 decision.
- `166` Processing native attachment upload:
  - Adds append-only operational uploads only under
    `native/<record_id>/<uuid>-<filename>`, metadata registration, and Activity.
    Authenticated users cannot write the Asana-import namespace and have no
    UPDATE/DELETE policy.
  - PROD-applied and browser/static proven.
- `170` Processing detach farm-team cutover:
  - Reissues cattle/sheep detach RPCs with authenticated caller attribution,
    program-authorized `farm_team` access, batch-first lock order, and membership
    revalidation; client and login-gated webform detach paths use the RPCs.
  - PROD-applied and verified. Migration `100`'s conflicting sheep batch-delete
    lock order remains Build Queue item 5.
- `171` Audited user management:
  - Adds deny-all immutable `user_management_audit`, admin-only profile mutation
    RPCs, guarded delete prepare/finalize/reconciliation, and the two-system Auth
    deletion contract used by `rapid-processor` v29.
  - PROD-applied and TEST migration-proven. Retained operational profile FKs
    intentionally refuse hard delete and direct admins to deactivate. Residual
    Edge proof/scope/UI-concurrency work is Build Queue item 4.
- `172` Processing template suite v1:
  - Seeds one canonical Broiler/Cattle/Pig/Sheep template only when a program has
    no template rows and adds checkbox/URL validation to the field engine.
  - PROD-applied. These v1 rows are retained but inactive after `174`.
- `173` Processing conversation media:
  - Atomically links imported Asana media to immutable imported comments and the
    Processing attachment index with original author/time and idempotent storage
    provenance.
  - PROD-applied; 8 files are live in `processing-attachments`, including the two
    B-26-04 Brian Naide JPG posts. Idempotent rerun wrote no duplicates.
- `174` Processing template suite v2 / UI simplification:
  - Fail-closed upgrade from untouched v1 fields, preserving checklists verbatim;
    retires six visible fields and makes Broiler Customer a settings-backed
    single select like Processor. Broiler has 11 fields; other programs have 10.
  - PROD-applied. Active v2 checklist sizes are 8/16/11/16, v1 rows remain
    inactive, and no `processing_records` row was changed.
- `175` Processing planner foundation:
  - Rekeys planner-backed Processing rows to immutable source identity, hardens
    planner-source matching, backfills source phase/ordinal values, and preserves
    source facts as Planner-owned.
  - TEST proof and PROD apply passed before the runtime push.
- `176` Processing lifecycle reconcile:
  - Adds lifecycle reconcile behavior for planned/actual Pig trip promotion,
    source-date removal, worked archive versus empty removal, restore, Chicago
    boundary timing, and fail-closed correction paths.
  - TEST proof used stamped fixture ids after Codex review found and CC fixed a
    collision risk; PROD apply passed with migration file unchanged.
- `177` Processing workflow integration:
  - Adds completion/notification/template-step workflow integration, removes
    Processing subtask dates, normalizes option-list objects, and widens the
    notification check for the new Processing work types.
  - PROD-applied before the runtime push; `processing-asana-sync` was redeployed
    afterward with planned-Pig exclusion live.

Special migration notes:

- `082` is intentionally unused.
- `167`-`169` are intentionally unused; the sequence jumps from Processing
  migration `166` to detach/user-management migrations `170`/`171`, then resumes
  Processing migration work at `172`-`177`.
- `083` public webform submitter identity is shelved.
- `085` was applied before `084` in PROD so duplicate active daily identities
  were cleaned up before unique indexes.
- Migration number `061` (an early daily-report soft-delete/restore step) is a
  skipped/superseded number; `067_daily_soft_delete.sql` is the live daily
  soft-delete migration. No `061` file exists in the repo tree/history; if a PROD
  ledger entry for `061` ever matters, confirm it read-only before relying on it.
- New or changed SECDEF RPC return shapes need `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`.
- PROD `exec_sql` is forbidden. Preferred PROD SQL apply remains `psql` with
  `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` per [HO.md](HO.md). The 2026-06-24 `139`-`142` release used
  Supabase's linked `db query` path with an explicit `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` wrapper
  because no raw `PROD_DB_URL` was present in the shell.

### Storage Buckets And Media

Known document/photo surfaces are locked by static guards:

- `daily-photos`.
- `task-photos`.
- `task-request-photos`.
- `comment-photos`.
- `equipment-maintenance-docs`.
- `fuel-bills`.
- `cattle-feed-pdfs`.
- `batch-documents`.
- `processing-attachments`.

Newsletter buckets are current PROD infrastructure as of 2026-06-26:
`newsletter-staging` is private/admin-only for uploads and copied planner photos
before approval; `newsletter-public` is public-read/admin-write and receives
only approved newsletter photo bytes.

Processing attachments Storage is current PROD infrastructure as of 2026-07-11:
`processing-attachments` is private; reads require authenticated operational
roles (`farm_team`, `management`, `admin`). Migration `166` permits authenticated
operational INSERT only under the append-only `native/` namespace; the Asana
namespace remains service-role only. Eight Asana conversation-media objects
(about 20.4 MB) are stored and indexed. The ordinary Asana attachment backfill
has not run; its last pre-media dry run enumerated 67 task attachments, so a new
dry plan is required under Build Queue item 2.

Append-only upload expectations:

- Uploads use `upsert: false` unless a lane explicitly changes the contract.
- Duplicate-object errors are treated as retry success where the upload path is
  idempotent.
- Private buckets use signed URLs; public buckets use public URLs.
- No code should mutate `storage.objects` directly.

### Route Ownership

- `src/lib/routes.js` owns canonical paths and legacy aliases.
- `src/lib/activityRegistry.js` owns entity-to-record routes for Activity and
  notifications.
- `main.jsx` adapts URLs into view state. Do not add separate alias maps in
  views.

### Authentication And Roles

- Ronnie remains final gate owner.
- App roles include `admin`, `management`, `farm_team`, `equipment_tech`,
  `light`, and `inactive`.
- Runtime permission decisions must be enforced by RLS/RPCs, not just hidden UI.
- Report/form submission is login-required. The session user is the submitter;
  `owner_profile_id` is stamped server-side and client-supplied profile IDs are
  not trusted.
- Light allowlist excludes `/production`, `/weighins`, program dashboards,
  `/fleet`, `/activity`, `/admin`, and client-error review. `/pasture-map` is
  allowed for Light with pasture farm-team-level Map/Field working controls;
  runtime permission is enforced by RPC/RLS, not only by the client allowlist.

## Design System

### Typography

- Canonical font family: self-hosted `Hanken Grotesk`.
- Canonical font-size set: `10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 26`.
- Allowed display sizes: `32, 34, 36, 48, 56`.
- Canonical shared-component font-weight scale: `400, 500, 600, 700`.

### Color Hierarchy

- Ordinary main text uses pure black (`#000000`): primary section/card/row
  titles, labels, buttons, and primary animal or production numbers.
- Supporting text uses muted gray: helper copy, subtext, metadata, secondary
  labels, and non-primary category labels.
- Intentional accent/semantic text remains allowed where color carries meaning:
  warning/error/success/info states, weather rain/freeze cues, overdue labels,
  and text inside approved semantic pastel blocks.
- A text-color cleanup must be typography-only unless the build explicitly says
  it is redesigning the affected block's background.
- CP0 section A12 program-accent discipline: the locked program palette (pig `#2B4C9B`,
  broiler `#C7920A`, layer `#D2601A`, cattle `#8E3328`, sheep `#4CA035`,
  equip/admin `#6B7280`) may appear ONLY on (a) the selected nav/tab pill, (b) a
  small dot in mixed lists, (c) optionally one headline figure, and (d) the
  primary/brand button via per-program `--brand` re-tint. (d) is a ratified
  extension of A12.1's permitted-uses list, decided 2026-06-17. Program color is
  never general body text, stat numbers, card backgrounds, left-border accents,
  or a status-color override. Species/group/herd/breed names render as dot +
  black label, not colored text. The dark-green top-bar chrome stays green.

### Spacing And Controls

- Standard button pad is `10px 16px`.
- Standard button vertical pad is `10px`.
- Inputs/selects/textareas use radius `10` (`--radius-sm`, CP0 section A3), border
  `1px var(--border-strong)`, pad `8px 11px`, and brand focus treatment.

### Radius

- CP0 section A3: 10px is the floor for real UI controls. Canonical radius tokens are
  `10`, `12`, `14`, `999` (pill), and `'50%'` (circle); `0` is allowed for
  intentionally square edges. The values `4`-`9` are retired on real UI.
- Genuinely decorative sub-components (legend swatches, accent/LED bars, progress
  bars, dividers, inline-code chips, small color dots) keep a sub-10 radius ONLY
  on a line tagged with the `radius-allow` marker; the floor guard fails any
  untagged sub-10 radius.
- Scope exemptions: the `.home` island (`homeRedesign.css`) keeps `9/12/18`; the
  public `#webform-container` island owns its CP5-local radius/token set in the
  HTML shell CSS and stays intentionally separate from React app tokens.
- New sub-10px control/card/row radii require a Ronnie-approved amendment and a
  matching guard update.
- Guards: `radius_floor_static.test.js` (floor + allowlist) and
  `design_token_contract_static.test.js` (canonical set on locked primitives).

### Stacking And Elevation

- Dialog layer order keeps Confirm/Delete at toast `9000`; other overlays and
  modals remain below that tier in the shared z-index ladder.
- Header stacking contract: the sticky header bar establishes a stacking
  context, so its hamburger and notifications dropdowns portal to
  `document.body` at z-index `9000` (above page content such as the Pasture map
  chrome, below the blocking-modal tier). Do not rely on raising the bar's own
  z-index — that would regress the `500`-tier page modals.

### Save Model

- Explicit Save/Submit by surface class is mandatory for submit-style flows.
- Autosave is mandatory for edit-in-place flows.

### Canonical Components

- Use canonical role owners before introducing equivalent alternatives.
- Canonical owners include `RecordPageShell`, `RecordSequenceNav`,
  `recordPageControls`, `DeleteModal`, `ConfirmModal`, `InlineNotice`, and
  record collaboration primitives.
- Canonical list/data owners include `DataTable`, `Badge`, `StatusText`,
  `EmptyState`, `OperationalListEmptyState`, `SectionBand`, `Toolbar`, `Tabs`,
  and `programColors`.
- `DataTable` is the default owner for row-comparable list surfaces. It owns the
  real table, mobile stacked row, load/error/empty, Active/Complete band, and
  keyboard row-open behavior.

---

## Load-Bearing Contracts

### Cross-App Rules

- Do not bypass RLS with client-side assumptions.
- Do not add browser secrets beyond approved `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`,
  `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and approved dev/test flags.
- Do not create new Supabase clients outside `src/lib/supabase.js`.
- Do not use raw browser `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt` in product surfaces.
- Do not add route aliases outside `src/lib/routes.js`.
- Do not edit docs during normal build/hotfix lanes unless Ronnie explicitly
  asks for docs or wrap work.

### Cold-Boot And Fail-Closed Loading

Data surfaces must fail closed on load errors:

- Record pages render in this order: loading -> loadError -> not-found -> record.
- List/hub surfaces expose `data-<surface>-loaded` markers and gate rows/empty
  states behind `!loadError`.
- Load failures clear stale rows/state, show `InlineNotice`, and should provide a
  user-gated Retry.
- Sidecar reads may degrade best-effort only when the primary record/list load
  is valid.
- Header badge counts soft-fail; Header panel content fails closed.

### Activity, Comments, Mentions, Notifications

- Activity is audit/system history. Comments are user discussion.
- Runtime Activity access goes through SECDEF RPCs: `list_activity_events`,
  `list_global_activity`, `record_activity_event`, and domain-specific SECDEF
  RPCs that insert `activity_events`.
- No direct client `.from('activity_events')`, `.from('activity_mentions')`,
  `.from('comments')`, or `.from('comment_edits')`.
- Legacy Activity composer/count RPCs remain retired; do not use them.
- `RecordActivityLog` filters `comment.posted` and shows audit only.
- `CommentsSection` owns discussion, attachments, edit history, soft delete, and
  mentions.
- Mention bodies stay human-readable `@Name`; UUIDs do not appear in body text.
- Mention notifications route to the operational record page and target comment.
- Valid notification types: `task_completed`, `mention`, `comment_mention`,
  `todo_completion_approved`, `todo_completion_rejected`, `todo_converted`, and
  `todo_completion_submitted`.
- Notification writes happen inside SECDEF paths; client code must not insert or
  delete notifications.

### Activity Entity Additions

A new Activity entity requires all of this:

- SQL `_activity_can_read` branch.
- `activityRegistry` entry.
- Route/deep-link mapping.
- Permission and existence semantics.
- Record or workflow surface.
- Static test coverage.
- Activity/event logging strategy.

Workflow/worktable entities:

- `cattle.forecast` uses entity_id `cattle-forecast`; Forecast month bucket logs
  filter by `payload.month_key`.
- `cattle.breeding` uses entity_id `cattle-breeding`.
- These are table/workflow audit streams and are program-gated rather than
  row-existence gated.

### Entity Mutations And Audit Atomicity

- `runMutation` is for routine client-side mutations with best-effort Activity.
- `runMutation` must not know table names or business rules.
- `runMutation` is not transactional.
- Audit-critical delete/restore/transfer/status flows should move to SECDEF RPCs
  that mutate data and insert Activity in one transaction.
- Mutation inventory counts live in
  `mutation_semantics_inventory_static.test.js`.

### Delete, Restore, And Recovery

- Hard-delete owner inventory lives in `hard_delete_owner_static.test.js`.
- Soft-delete protected roots must not have direct client deletes: cattle,
  sheep, `cattle_dailys`, `sheep_dailys`, `poultry_dailys`, `layer_dailys`,
  `egg_dailys`, `pig_dailys`.
- Daily reports soft-delete through `soft_delete_daily_report` and restore
  through `restore_daily_report`.
- Cattle/sheep animals soft-delete/restore through their animal RPCs.
- Calving sub-row delete goes through `delete_cattle_calving_record`.

### Production

- Production means processed animals and eggs, not current inventory.
- There is no combined production total. Home and `/production` display per-
  program totals only.
- `/production` is a production reporting surface, not an import reconciliation
  workspace. Visible page language should be totals/events by program and year;
  do not expose Planner-vs-backfill/source-split/audit framing in the primary
  page.
- Production sources:
  - Broilers from `app_store.ppp-v4` processed/auto-processed batches.
  - Pigs from `app_store.ppp-feeders-v1.processingTrips`.
  - Cattle from `cattle_processing_batches.actual_process_date`.
  - Sheep from `sheep_processing_batches.actual_process_date`.
  - Eggs from `egg_dailys` counts, displayed as dozens.
  - Legacy backfill from `production_legacy_events`.
- Internal reconciliation: Planner wins by program/year coverage. If Planner has
  events for a program/year, Planner is the counted total and every legacy row
  for that same program/year is held out internally, including rows that
  represent the same batch dated differently. If Planner has no events for a
  program/year, legacy rows count as historical backfill.
- `/production` must not display Podio terminology, Raw-Podio columns, or
  delta-vs-Podio columns. It also must not display a visible Reconciliation tab,
  Legacy/Audit Review panel, source split, Held out, or Conflict columns.
- YoY is per program/year, not across programs.
- Summary is an all-years Program x Year matrix. Production Events show actual
  processing events only: no egg-day rows, no year picker, and imported legacy
  rows remain visible even when held out of Summary totals by the Planner-wins
  coverage rule.
- Processing events should link to record pages when a matching planner record
  can be confidently resolved, including broiler batch links by date/count.
- Light users are excluded by route allowlist and RPC role gate.

### Processing Calendar

- Processing Calendar is distinct from the existing `/production` reporting
  page. `/processing` is the workflow/schedule/record surface for processing
  batches, milestones, comments, attachments, custom fields, and subtasks.
  `/production` remains the processed-output reporting surface.
- Processing is now planner-first. Planner-backed rows own live batch facts
  (date/count/status/source identity). Asana can seed processor/customer only on
  first attach if blank, imports artifacts/history/drift one-way, and must never
  overwrite Planner-owned live facts after a match.
- Planner-to-Processing reconciliation is first-class. Broiler rows require a
  Planner processing date; Pig persisted planned trips immediately create/update
  Processing records by stable planned-trip identity, then promote to actual trip
  identity without losing processor, subtasks, completion state, comments,
  attachments, or history. Stale empty planner rows are removed; worked rows are
  archived by reconcile and unarchived if the source returns.
- The main Processing table must stay batch-focused. Subtasks are not a table
  column; they belong in the record drawer/artifact model. The Batch/title
  column is sticky in the horizontal table. Historical import, reconciliation,
  and maintenance controls are intentionally absent from the day-to-day UI.
  Admins get a direct Templates button and a single global Add milestone button;
  archived/cancelled rows are not exposed through a day-to-day Show archived
  checkbox.
- Parent-record Assignee and visible Time-on-Farm are retired from the Processing
  UI. Checklist/subtask assignees remain supported. The server may still return
  backward-compatible `time_on_farm_days`, but it is not a default template or
  drawer field.
- Customer and Processor selector options are server-backed Processing settings.
  Both are true single selects; Customer stores zero-or-one value in its legacy
  array-backed record column. Admins edit choices inside Templates through
  `set_processing_option_list`; stored off-list values remain visible and old
  multi-customer rows show one explicit legacy state until deliberately replaced.
- Templates are local-only in the product UI. The active canonical v2 suite is
  Broiler 11 fields and Cattle/Pig/Sheep 10 fields, with checklists 8/16/11/16.
  The template modal uses a Tasks/Fields toggle; Fields edit inline rather than
  opening a second modal. The six retired field ids stay server-reserved so
  generic writes cannot revive them. Template saves version active rows; reset
  uses the same guarded defaults as migration `174`.
- Asana operations are out-of-UI gated operations. Planner freshness still runs
  automatically. Read-only audits/dry runs, artifact import, attachment backfill,
  historical Activity import, and `asana_sync_enabled` cutover require explicit
  operational approval; removal of the UI controls is not permission to run them.
- Processing attachment files live in private `processing-attachments` Storage.
  Reads require operational authenticated roles. Native uploads are append-only
  under `native/`; Asana imports are service-role only. Eight conversation-media
  files are live and indexed; ordinary backfill has not run and needs a fresh dry
  plan because its 67-attachment inventory predates the media import.
- Processing Calendar status vocabulary is exactly `Planned`, `In Process`,
  and `Complete`, rendered from the server-derived `effective_status`
  (migration `176`): a record stays Planned until its processing date begins in
  America/Chicago, reads In Process automatically from that date (or whenever
  an actual Pig trip exists, regardless of date), and becomes Complete only
  through the explicit Mark complete action once the server-side blockers pass
  (date begun, Processor selected, live source Count > 0, every subtask
  completed or removed). Stored statuses are normalized to the same three
  values and the planner reconcile never copies raw native program statuses
  into Processing. `src/lib/processingStatusDisplay.js` still maps raw/legacy
  values for display, and Pig BATCH pages (not `/processing`) keep the
  pig-specific helper because raw `active` can mean either a future zero-head
  placeholder (`Planned`) or pigs already in the feeder workflow
  (`In Process`).
- Processing schedule rows sort by `processing_date` inside each program section
  regardless of status. Do not reintroduce an In Process / Planned / Complete
  display bucket; completed rows must stay in their natural schedule slot.
- The Asana token is a live secret and must not be committed, pasted into docs,
  or stored in source. The deployed Edge Function reads it from Supabase secrets.
  It is currently SET on the PROD Edge secret (the dry-run + comments lanes
  proved live connectivity); redeploying the Edge does not re-set it.
- Existing CP0/design-system contracts apply. Do not copy prototype styles that
  conflict with true-black text, radius floor, closed badge set, table hover,
  row-lift openable affordance, or program-accent rules unless Ronnie approves
  a Constitution amendment.

### Monthly Newsletter

- Current shipped scope is Newsletter Autopilot + the direction-first redesign +
  archive-link gating: link-gated public archive + admin editor, migrations
  `144`/`145` (data/storage/public boundary), `146` (automation/run logging/cron
  RPC support), `151` (Autopilot settings/source coverage/photo plan/past-issue
  context), `153` (archive-link gating), and the `newsletter-harvest` Edge
  Function (PROD v6 / TEST v1). Autopilot gathers planner facts first, lets Ronnie
  steer facts/Q&A/tone/length, writes or revises with AI/template composer,
  generates a photo plan, supports private upload + approval + place planned
  photos, previews, and publishes. The real AI path is enabled in PROD through the
  PROD-only `NEWSLETTER_AI_API_KEY` Edge Function secret; TEST is intentionally
  not configured with that key.
- UI: the admin (`/admin/newsletter`) and public (`/newsletter`) surfaces follow
  the direction-first redesign (PR #54), built on the app's design tokens +
  shared primitives. Admin = a "this month" spotlight + section-banded openable
  tiles (list), a 7-step tracker (Facts · Steer · Draft · Revise · Photos ·
  Review · Publish) over step cards + a 312px utility rail (editor), and a grouped
  in-view Settings sub-surface (no route alias). Public = an editorial masthead,
  hover-lift archive cards, an issue page with numbers strip + reading time +
  sign-off + "More issues". The draft stays AI-owned (read-only blocks, revise-in-
  place, guarded rewrite).
- ACCESS (migration `153`, PR #59): the public archive is LINK-GATED, not open.
  `/newsletter`, `/newsletter/latest`, and issue slugs require a current,
  unexpired `?key=` (one shared archive access token in `newsletter_settings`
  that unlocks the new issue + all past issues). Publish mints a fresh 7-day key;
  the admin "Public link" card (Copy/Regenerate) rotates it on demand (instant
  revoke when someone leaves). A missing/invalid/expired key shows a "link
  expired" lock screen. The goal is that former staff can never keep a working
  link. Admins always read every issue via the authed admin RPCs regardless of
  the public key state. The draft preview (`?preview=<token>`) is a SEPARATE path
  with its own 30-day token and is unchanged by `153`.
- Public issue pages must be `noindex`; this is an invariant, not a setting admins
  can accidentally drift.
- Admin creation/editing lives inside the planner and is admin-only. The public
  reader surface is web-only; no PDF, email send, RSS, or reader login is part
  of the current requirement.
- The newsletter voice is factual positive PR for owners and periphery staff,
  styled like White Creek Farm's current emails. Titles follow the pattern
  `White Creek Farm June Review`; target length is about two pages.
- Content should be based on prior-month facts: animals on farm, births, notable
  processing/production/yield records, and other genuinely noteworthy good-news
  events. Do not include finances or mortalities. First names of team members
  are OK; avoid sensitive/private details and never expose private file paths.
- Fact accuracy mirrors the app's canonical logic (PR #50/#55). Broilers "brought
  to processing" counts `totalToProcessor` (NOT the unpopulated processed-count
  fields), windows on the brought date (`processingDate − 1`, since a batch goes
  to the processor the day before its processing date), and falls back to
  projected live birds (`birdCountActual − mortalityCumulative`) for a batch
  brought-but-not-yet-tallied (self-corrects once `totalToProcessor` is entered).
- Year-over-year production: the harvest appends a deterministic
  "Production — year over year" stats section (exact, never AI-authored) to every
  draft — full-year vs prior-full-year for all five Production-tab programs
  (cattle/broilers/pigs/sheep/eggs), mirroring the tab's per-program quantity
  rules + Planner-wins-by-coverage (legacy backfills only program-years with no
  Planner data); eggs shown in dozens. Logic lives in the parity-locked
  `newsletterProductionYoy.js` (src/lib + `_shared` mirror); a strip-then-reappend
  keeps it from duplicating on revise.
- The monthly workflow is minimum-human-input but Ronnie-directed:
  gather this month's facts from planner sources without AI, let Ronnie select/
  add facts and answer Monthly Q&A, then AI writes a draft and photo shot-list.
  Revisions should edit the current draft in place. Photo requests should be
  generated from what is noteworthy; admins can add/remove suggestions and must
  approve photos before publication. Every issue should have at least a few
  photos.
- AI generation must stay inside the planner via a fixed prompt/template in the
  API/Edge Function setup. The model returns structured blocks only; the
  renderer whitelists block types and never renders raw AI HTML. Ronnie remains
  the final editorial approver.
- Data boundary: newsletter tables are deny-all RLS and exposed only through
  narrow SECURITY DEFINER RPCs. The anon surface is exactly three RPCs — published
  list, published issue, and token-gated preview. As of migration `153` the
  published list + published issue are additionally ARCHIVE-KEY-GATED (they take
  `p_key` and return NULL unless it matches the current, unexpired
  `archive_access_token`, constant-time compare via `_newsletter_archive_key_ok`);
  the preview RPC keeps its own draft token. Public and preview payloads expose
  approved photo paths only; draft facts, intake, runs, settings, and private
  source paths stay admin-only. The harvest detectors + draft composer run
  server-side inside `newsletter-harvest` (so detector/composer changes require an
  Edge Function redeploy).
- Photo boundary: uploads/copies start in private `newsletter-staging`. Approval
  copies bytes to public `newsletter-public`; unapproval deletes the public copy.
  A photo row being present or suggested is not public consent.
- Preview boundary: preview links require `preview_enabled=true`, a matching
  token, and an unexpired `preview_expires_at`. Publish rotates/disables preview
  links so a pre-publication URL cannot expose later draft edits.

### Pasture Map

- Pasture Map architecture is provider-neutral: GeoJSON/PostGIS owns geometry;
  Leaflet renders the client map; OnX KML and drawn polygons are input sources;
  Google is not the geometry source.
- `land_areas` is the single self-referencing land model. It can represent
  pasture > paddock and feeder-pig area > section > paddock.
- Geometry history is append-only in `land_area_geometry_versions`; editing a
  boundary writes a new version instead of mutating history.
- Species is decoupled from land. `designation` is only a hint; animal-group
  occupancy belongs to dated move events in `pasture_move_events`.
- Imported/drawn land starts `baseline_no_history=true`; no fake last-grazed
  date is seeded.
- LineStrings are outline candidates and require human close/validation. Never
  auto-close an OnX LineString. In the UI these are called Tracks / Lines and
  are draft geometry only: no acreage, no move destination, no direct permanent
  promotion. Management/admin can reshape an existing saved Track/Line in place
  through `update_land_area_track`; this is line-only, outline-candidate-only,
  and does not write acreage, promotion, or geometry-version history.
- Computed acreage is geodesic and the UI shows it read-only. OnX/raw/manual
  acreage can exist as cross-check data, but the normal editing path must not
  ask users to type acreage or rest days.
- Draw/edit controls use Leaflet-Geoman. Snapping, live area/perimeter measure,
  Escape exit, and client self-intersection warnings are UI requirements; the
  migration `127` RPC validity gates are the database backstop. Measure is
  transient and must never persist a land area/track/temp paddock.
- Planner groups are derived, not user-entered. Canonical move/planning keys are:
  cattle herds -> `animal_type='cattle_herd'`, `group_key=herd`; sheep flocks ->
  `animal_type='sheep_flock'`, `group_key=flock`; breeder pigs ->
  `animal_type='breeder_pigs'`, `group_key='sow-1'|'sow-2'|'sow-3'|'boars'`;
  feeder pigs -> `animal_type='feeder_pigs'`, `group_key=sub.id`.
- Access: `farm_team`, `management`, `admin` can read/view/measure and use the
  Map working controls. Management/admin own permanent area import/classify/
  close/draw/edit, Tracks / Lines cleanup, promotion, and permanent-area
  lifecycle actions. Farm-team can record moves through the group record move
  box and create/edit/archive their own temp paddocks/tracks through migration
  `135`.
  `equipment_tech` and inactive users are excluded. Light is pasture farm-team-
  level through migration `139`: Light keeps the farm-team Map/Field working
  controls and is NOT read-only/Map-only; only management/admin-only actions stay
  gated, and write/report RPCs reject roles outside the granted set.
- Current Pasture Map tabs are Map / Field / Reports. Plan is folded into Map;
  Setup was already removed. Map is the single working surface: hover/tap reads
  a name + type/acres-only bubble (no rest/grazing state, occupant, or
  last-moved line); clicking a map area opens the accessible Area MODAL
  (`PastureAreaModal.jsx`:
  role=dialog, aria-modal, focus trap, backdrop) which hosts the same canonical
  Area Record body used by Reports: area summary, explicit name editor, Grazing
  History, and role-gated management/config controls (classification, parent
  pasture, line style, redraw, archive/restore, admin hard-delete). There is NO
  move form in the modal. The modal has one close affordance, the upper-right
  `X`, and it debounces/saves review edits on close. Area name editing is
  explicit Edit -> Save/Cancel with Enter-to-save and Escape-to-cancel; do not
  reintroduce blur-save naming.
  The slim side panel holds Animal Groups pop-out openable tiles, not flat
  tables. A group tile opens an inline group record beside the map, not a modal.
  The record order is group details, chip-based rotation editor, current->next
  move box with date/time and optional actual group weight, then grazing
  history. The rotation editor owns future planning; the old planned-move
  table/RPCs and free-form Record/Plan forms are removed. Tracks / Lines, the
  classification/review queue, and archived recovery are collapsed sections in
  Reports. Reviewed permanent paddocks require a parent pasture (UI-enforced via
  `update_land_area` `p_parent_id`; no DB constraint, no auto-backfill);
  parentless paddocks surface in a Reports "Needs pasture assignment" section.
  Field is phone-first execution/offline queue. The Field bottom toolbar is
  Walk paddock / Draw paddock / Measure only; one-time setup/help lives in a
  secondary "Offline setup" status-row affordance (offline NAIP imagery
  download + the self-contained field guide) and saved measurements in a
  secondary "Saved measurements" toggle; the rail base/overlay popover stays available
  in Field. The field guide is served from `public/pasture-map-field-guide.html`
  (self-contained, inline images); `public/sw.js` serves an exact runtime-cached
  navigation before the SPA shell fallback so the guide works offline after one
  online open; `ensurePersistentStorage()` requests persistent storage on mount.
  A temp paddock drawn from the rotation editor stays saveable while the inline
  group record is open. Reports use pop-out openable
  tiles for Areas and Animal Groups; opening an Area renders the same canonical
  Area Record body. Reports also include animal-group grazing stays/metrics,
  inactive groups behind an Include inactive groups filter, and per-stay delete.
  Track/Line records hide grazing history, state, acreage, and rested-day rows.
  Light is pasture farm-team-level on the merged Map and Field.
- Map chrome is one right-side icon rail: Fit Farm, My Location, base/overlay,
  and Legend. The base/overlay control is a popover containing Satellite/Topo base map selection plus
  Pastures/Paddocks/Temp/Lines overlay toggles. Legend is a separate popover,
  mutually exclusive with the base/overlay popover. Hybrid basemap and hybrid reference/transport
  overlay code are removed. Zoom is scroll-wheel/pinch only; Leaflet default
  zoom controls and custom rail +/- buttons are intentionally absent.
- Move ledger / coloring contract: an area's occupancy/rest state is
  read-derived in `_land_area_summary` from `pasture_move_impacts`
  (`destination`/`overlap`/`departure`), not stored on `land_areas`.
  `record_pasture_move` still writes overlap impacts for intersecting areas, but
  migration `147` suppresses direct-child overlap impacts when deriving parent
  pasture state. Migration `149` additionally ignores orphan impacts whose move
  event has lost its directional
  `to_land_area_id`/`from_land_area_id` link, so an area cannot read
  "Resting/Last grazed" without a visible stay or non-orphan impact explaining
  it. A permanent paddock's bright-green stroke is a LOCKED designation color,
  independent of state; the FILL is the state.
- Boundary visibility toggles hide/show pasture, paddock, temp-paddock, or
  Lines/Tracks strokes only. Animal occupancy fills and group markers remain
  visible. A group's occupied-area marker is a teardrop location pin in the
  group color with a "Name · count" label (no initials avatar); rotation stops
  are numbered dots, and the number at the group's current area is suppressed so
  it does not stack under the pin. Draft lines render on the working Map; Field
  has a Draft lines toggle; selected draft lines show for context.
- Permanent pasture stroke is locked blue 4px; permanent paddock stroke is
  locked bright green 4px. Temp paddocks default to white dashed 5px and can be
  restyled. Only temp paddocks and GPS/field tracks have editable line style.
- Open-line edit is built. Entry points are the Area modal and Reports
  Tracks/Lines list. It routes through `update_land_area_track`, preserves
  Tracks/Lines draft semantics, and must not be broadened to polygon boundary
  edit or promotion without a new scoped migration/guard.
- Current Pasture Map includes the real-roster redesign, move ledger,
  animal-color occupancy, pop-out openable launch tiles, inline group records,
  chip-based rotation planning, group-record move logging, actual-weight
  grazing metrics, per-stay grazing delete, history/rest/stocking reports,
  offline vector snapshot/queue, offline NAIP imagery cache, GPS field tracks,
  line styling/pattern controls, temp-paddock lifecycle, the single-X Area
  modal, the shared Map/Reports Area Record body, explicit area-name editor,
  open-line edit, and Light pasture farm-team-level Map/Field access. It does
  not include daily-report wiring or a generic undo stack; corrections are
  delete the grazing stay and re-record the move.
- Future Pasture Map lanes should preserve the shipped Map / Field / Reports IA,
  the click-to-open Area modal, the Reports accordion, and the provider-neutral
  geometry/RPC model unless a new Ronnie-approved decision explicitly reopens
  any of them.

### Daily Reports

- Daily reports have dedicated record pages for poultry, layer, egg, pig, cattle,
  and sheep.
- Daily report list surfaces and Home "Last 5 Days" use shared white
  `DailyRecordCards` / `.hoverable-tile` record cards, including the Home-tile
  lift, focus ring, and trailing chevron at every breakpoint.
- All six open directly editable; no edit-mode toggle.
- Daily duplicate prevention is DB-backed for poultry/pig/layer/cattle/sheep by
  partial unique indexes (`084`) after cleanup (`085`); egg duplicate prevention
  is warning/pre-submit only.
- Add Feed quick-log rows are not full daily reports.
- Missed-report checks exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Daily edits route through `updateDailyReport` / `update_daily_report`.
- Daily deletes route through `soft_delete_daily_report`.
- Light can edit/delete only own rows inside the server-side window.

### Cattle And Sheep

- Cattle and sheep use dedicated Supabase tables, not `app_store`.
- Active cattle herds: `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, `bulls`.
- Active sheep flocks: `rams`, `ewes`, `feeders`.
- Outcome states are `processed`, `deceased`, `sold`.
- Cattle Herds default to grouped, collapsible herd tiles when no
  filters/search/non-default sort are active. Any active filter/search/non-default
  sort renders one flat matched-results table through the shared `DataTable`.
  The `Sold` herd filter is flat and sold-only; it must not retain
  Processed/Deceased/Sold group headers. `Last Activity` sort/column reads the
  cattle animal Activity stream through `listActivityEvents`, shows date/time,
  defaults newest-first, and sorts missing activity last.
- Cattle nutrition rolling-window dashboard math must use true dry matter:
  `as-fed pounds * (1 - moisture_pct/100)` for `DM lb/day`; CP and NFC pounds
  use the feed-line nutrition snapshot percentages against that dry matter, not
  raw as-fed pounds.
- Sheep Flocks render a single always-flat list (the grouped/flat view toggle was
  removed). A column/display picker chooses which of the full field set shows;
  `tag` is always shown; the choice persists in saved views (`columnVisible`
  gates `flatColumns`). Outcome flocks stay browsable in
  `SheepCollapsibleOutcomeSections` below the flat list. Do not reintroduce a
  sheep `viewMode` toggle.
- Heifer-to-cow promotion fires from both calving records and calf-row dam links.
- Manual transfer goes through `transfer_cattle_animal` /
  `transfer_sheep_animal`.
- Processing-batch unschedule/delete go through audited SECDEF RPCs
  `unschedule_cattle_processing_batch` / `delete_sheep_processing_batch`.
- Cattle animal records in outcome states show `Age at processing` / `Age at
  sale` / `Age at death` from the terminal event date (processing-batch date,
  sale date, or death date); active herds show current `Age`. Cattle
  processing-batch rows show each cow's age at the batch processing date.
- Cattle Log (`/cattle/log`) is a comment-backed program field journal on the
  singleton `cattle.log` entity. It supports keyword search, @mentions, photo
  attachments, offline create replay, issue filters, and #tag mirrors.

### Pig

- Pig feeder group started counts are authoritative.
- Current count is ledger-derived, not persisted `currentCount`.
- `pig.batch` record pages own metadata, sub-batches, mortality, planned trips,
  processing trips, forecast/current/FCR, send-to-trip source display, Comments,
  and Activity.
- Keep pig batch workflow split across `PigBatchPage`, `PigBatchHubTile`,
  `usePigMortality`, `usePigSubBatches`, `usePigPlannedTrips`, and
  `usePigProcessingTrips`.
- `PigContext.feedersLoaded` is the readiness boundary.
- Farm-born feeder batches are created from farrowing cycles, not manually from
  `/pig/batches`.
- Planned-trip row shape stays `{id, date, sex, subBatchId, plannedCount,
  order}`.
- Planned-trip locks live only in `ppp-pig-planned-trip-locks-v1`.
- Planned-trip forecast weights are render-only and based on DOB/farrowing age
  at trip date times Global ADG.
- Pig Batches hub rows use the locked 14-column inspection grid and open the
  batch record page.
- Breeding pigs (`/pig/sows`) are grouped table sections. The row is the record
  navigation target. Do not reintroduce the old PigTile/Record-button/modal-only
  workflow.
- Breeding-pig record pages use `pig.breeder` and mount Comments + Activity.
- Pig weigh-in record pages render entries in a dense table, not cards/badges.
  The leftmost column is the send-to-trip checkbox for eligible draft rows;
  sent/transferred rows are locked in-row. Weight/note autosave, prior weight,
  days, delta, ADG, undo send, transfer to breeding, undo transfer, and delete
  remain preserved.
- `/pig/weighins` is a navigation list split into Active and Complete sections.
  Pig list saved views, CSV export, Print, and status filters are intentionally
  removed. Broiler weigh-in lists keep the shared saved-view/export/print/filter
  behavior.

### Broiler, Layers, And Feed Planning

- Broiler batches live in `ppp-v4`.
- Broiler Batches filtering/sort/saved-views and the column/display picker are
  scoped to the PROCESSED table only; active/planned batches stay pinned above
  the controls. Filter/sort semantics live in the pure module
  `src/lib/broilerBatchFilters.js` (processing-date-desc default). Batch
  Comparison was removed - do not reintroduce it.
- Login-gated `/weighins` cannot read or mutate `app_store.ppp-v4` directly.
- Week 4/6 completion uses `stamp_broiler_batch_avg` RPC.
- Broiler batch record Week 4 and Week 6 weight fields are read-only display
  values sourced from completed weigh-ins via `loadBroilerBatchWeekAverages`;
  this is canonical for record display and prevents stale `ppp-v4` cache values
  from showing as "Not recorded."
- `ppp-v4.week4Lbs` / `week6Lbs` remain the mirror used by list/production
  surfaces. Admin/session-page write paths use `writeBroilerBatchAvg` and
  `recomputeBroilerBatchWeekAvg`; real `app_store` read/upsert failures must
  surface as `{ok:false,message}`. True no-data cases may no-op with
  `{ok:true}`.
- Broiler `persist(nb)` in `src/main.jsx` must keep the anonymous weigh-in
  webform mirrors fresh by calling
  `syncWebformConfig(null, null, nb, layerGroups, layerHousings)`.
- B-26-08 wk6 was repaired in PROD after the drift hardening deploy:
  `ppp-v4.week6Lbs` is 5.76 and matches canonical 5.76 from 30 completed
  weigh-in weights.
- Layer `current_count` is the physical anchor; projected count subtracts
  mortalities since anchor. Layer housing record surfaces now label the
  displayed count as live hens and use the projected live count when the raw
  physical anchor is stale/empty but daily-count history provides a valid
  anchor; Eggmobile 3 / `L-25-01` displays 112 live hens from anchor 115 minus
  three mortalities.
- Feed math lives in `src/lib/feedPlanner.js` and `src/lib/feedOrderBasis.js`.
- Feed-order recommendations use the latest active-month physical count when
  present; otherwise they fall back to previous-month estimate.
- Poultry feed-order math is per feed type: starter, grower, layerfeed.
- "Count includes `<month>` order" prevents double-counting the delivery.
- The feed-order board is calendar-pinned. Pig and broiler both show the next
  calendar month order card until the calendar advances; saving the order does
  not advance the visible board to the following month.
- The second feed summary tile for pig and broiler stays pinned to the current
  calendar month estimate via `estTileYM`.
- Broiler on-farm counts are centralized in `computeBroilerOnFarmCounts`.
- Broiler batch status auto-advances in `loadAllData`: planned -> active on/after
  hatch date, active -> processed on/after processing date.

### Tasks

- `/tasks` is canonical. `/my-tasks` and `/admin/tasks` are aliases only.
- Task writes go through v2 wrappers/RPCs.
- Frontend must not call `generate_system_task_instance`; `tasks-cron` is the
  runtime caller for system-task generation.
- System task rules live in `task_system_rules`; assignee and active state stay
  data-driven there, and the cron uses `lead_time_days` as the minting horizon.
- `tasks-cron` is deployed and active in PROD. The deployed function includes
  system-task generation with batch/group entity labels plus To Do approval/
  originator notifications; the daily cron remains `tasks-cron-daily` at
  `0 4 * * *` UTC through `public.invoke_tasks_cron()`.
- Existing open system-generated task titles were backfilled by migration `142`;
  newly generated system tasks get titles in the form
  `<rule name> - <entity label>`.
- `task_instance_photos` is canonical. Legacy single-photo columns are display
  fallback only.
- Task photos are capped at 5 total per task across creation and completion;
  migration `114` is the DB backstop.
- To Do List lives inside Task Center at `/tasks/todo` and `/tasks/todo/<id>`.
- To Do participants are `light`, `farm_team`, `management`, and `admin`;
  `equipment_tech` and inactive are excluded.
- Non-manager To Do completion submissions enter `pending_approval` and notify
  management/admin; approval or auto-approval notifies the To Do creator.

### Equipment

- Logged-in equipment lives under `/fleet`.
- Login-gated equipment checklist/fueling lives under `/equipment`.
- Equipment fueling submissions use `submit_equipment_fueling` RPC.
- Light My Submissions edits/deletes its own equipment fuelings and fuel
  supplies through ownership RPCs.
- Fuel-log edit/delete paths recompute current readings from remaining fuel logs.
- Equipment checklist/material edits must not reload, lose focus, or reorder list
  items on click/edit.
- Home `Materials Needed` service groups must remain stable when a material is
  cleared; clearing one item must not reorder later interval groups or move them
  to the bottom of the list.
- Admin client error review is at `/admin/client-errors` and reads through
  `list_client_errors` only.

### Login-Gated Webforms And Offline Queue

- Login-gated webforms must not read `app_store` directly or use browser
  secrets.
- Former public forms now use Supabase auth state intentionally for login and
  locked submitter identity.
- Light is allowed only on contained report/form surfaces plus pasture
  farm-team-level `/pasture-map` access. Weigh-ins and Production remain outside
  the Light allowlist.
- Offline queue IndexedDB ownership is centralized in `src/lib/offlineQueue.js`.
- Offline RPC replay goes through `useOfflineRpcSubmit` where needed.
- Ownership stamping is server-side on replay.
- Shared TEST DB Playwright specs that reset/seed the DB must run one file at a
  time.

### Storage And File Inputs

- Upload owner/count guards are intentionally brittle.
- New upload/remove/signed/public URL owners require updating the matching static
  guard.
- Task, daily, and comment attachment uploads are append-only.
- Image file inputs intentionally omit `capture=` so mobile users can choose
  camera or library upload through the native picker.

### Runtime Observability

- `client_error_events` records redacted browser/runtime errors through
  `record_client_error`.
- `/admin/client-errors` is read-only, admin-gated, fail-closed, paginated, and
  uses `list_client_errors`.
- Client error reporting must not store raw localStorage, auth tokens, full
  payloads, or secret-like data.

### Shared UI And Record Chrome

- Global openable affordance is shared through `.hoverable-tile` for card/div
  openables and `.hoverable-row` for table-row openables.
- Do not put `.hoverable-tile` on `<tr>` or `.hoverable-row` on non-`tr`
  elements.
- `RecordPageShell` owns record-page frame/loading/not-found/body/title chrome.
- `RecordCollaborationSection` is the only component that composes
  `CommentsSection` and `RecordActivityLog`.
- `RecordActivityLog` is audit-only and filters `comment.posted`.
- `RecordSequenceNav` is the shared sequence-navigation primitive.
- `DataTable` owns table/list rendering for comparable records: real `<table>`,
  sticky header, `.hoverable-row` row-open, fail-closed load/error/empty states,
  optional row selection, Active/Complete `SectionBand`s, and mobile stacked
  record-lines.
- `Badge` is for true lifecycle/status labels only. Use `StatusText` for inline
  soft signals and supporting status ink.
- Program/species accents come from `src/lib/programColors.js` and should appear
  as dots, selected pills, or rare headline accents, not as status badges or
  broad surface themes.
- `Toolbar` owns page action bars; `Tabs` owns in-page tab strips. Header
  section navigation remains owned by `Header.jsx`.
- `app_saved_views` saved views are a generic per-surface primitive.
- `DeleteModal` and `ConfirmModal` are app-level modal primitives.
- CSV export ownership lives in `csvExport.js`; row-print export ownership lives
  in `printExport.js`.
- Record page controls live in `src/shared/recordPageControls.jsx`.

### Source Boundary Guards

Static guards lock these boundaries. If a legitimate new owner is added, update
the guard in the same lane and explain why:

- Supabase client owner.
- Browser secret/env usage.
- `app_store`, `webform_config`, `profiles` access.
- `localStorage` owner/key inventory.
- IndexedDB/offline queue owner.
- Notifications client-write prohibition.
- Task API boundary.
- Comments/Activity table access.
- Route alias ownership.
- Light portal/access boundary.
- Login-gated webforms boundary.
- Storage upload/remove/signed/public URL ownership.
- Append-only bucket upload contracts.
- Image file input capture contract.
- Hard-delete owner inventory.
- Mutation semantics inventory.
- CP2 daily writes via ownership RPCs.
- Delete/recovery classification.
- Legacy Activity retirement.
- Load/retry readiness inventory.
- Design token and radius-floor contracts.
- Shared UI extraction contract.
- Openable hover affordance contract.

Playwright notes:

- Specs that reset the shared TEST DB must run one file at a time.
- Local dev-server cold-start can hang if stray node/vite processes remain in
  old worktrees. Clear stale processes before diagnosing product flake.

## Agent Session Checklist

Before a new lane:

1. Read [HO.md](HO.md).
2. Read Current State, Build Queue, and the relevant contracts here.
3. Run `git status --short`, `git worktree list`, and inspect recent `git log`.
4. Identify dirty-tree risk, active worktrees, open gates, and migration state.
5. Inspect files in scope before planning.
6. If touching a boundary guard, update the guard in the same lane.
7. If touching SQL/RPC/RLS/Storage, state TEST/PROD apply and verification needs
   in the plan.
8. If approving a commit gate, queue the next CC-ready prompt in the same Codex
   response per [HO.md](HO.md).

## Archives

- Older narrative history: `archive/SESSION_LOG.md`.
- Research, screenshots, audits, and video evaluations:
  `C:\Users\Ronni\cc-research\` (workstation-local; outside the repo, so it will
  not resolve on another clone/agent).
- Parity audit evidence:
  `C:\Users\Ronni\cc-research\parity-audit-2026-06-05-CC.md` (workstation-local).
- Detailed build history lives in git log and tests. Keep this file as the
  compact project map, not a running transcript.
