# WCF Planner

Farm-management web app for White Creek Farm. React/Vite SPA, Supabase backend,
Netlify production deploy from GitHub `main`.

This file is project-specific truth: current state, active roadmap,
architecture map, and load-bearing contracts. Workflow, gates, and relay format
live in [HO.md](HO.md). Do not turn this file into a session transcript.

Last updated: 2026-05-23.

---

## Start Here

1. Read [HO.md](HO.md).
2. Read this file's Current State, Active Roadmap, and relevant Contracts.
3. Inspect `git status --short`, recent git log, and the files in the lane.

Default ownership: Codex plans/reviews; CC builds/validates. Codex edits source
only when Ronnie explicitly assigns it.

---

## Current State

- Production: `https://wcfplanner.com`
- Deploy: Netlify auto-deploy from `main`
- Latest live commit: `82e54a0 fix(activity): polish mentions and photo attachment indicators`
- PROD migrations live: `057` notifications, `058` activity events, `060` mention contract
- PROD migration drafted only: `059_daily_unique_indexes.sql` (not applied)
- CI note: verify may be red from known unrelated Playwright flakes. Do not mix
  CI-stabilization work into feature lanes.

### Recent Shipped Work

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Notifications Center | Live. `task_completed` and `mention` notifications use `public.notifications`. |
| Activity + @Mentions Phase 1 | Live on task instances. Per-tile activity panel, @ picker, mention fanout, task-completed activity trigger. |
| Mention polish | Live. Body stores plain `@Name`; server uses `p_mentions[]` as identity. |
| Home farrow window wording | Live, but needs follow-up to remove the confusing `N pending` text. |
| Mobile header refinements | Live. Mobile section pill hidden, notification bell real, fleet duplicate nav removed. |
| Tasks v2 | Canonical at `/tasks`; old `/my-tasks` and `/admin/tasks` are aliases. |

### Parked WIP Stash

Working tree is intentionally clean after wrap. The parked code lanes are saved
in a named stash:

- Stash message: `wip: parked code lanes before wrap 2026-05-23`
- Stash hash: `18a753e1ed36a1e1556069b918492196895fdc14`
- Current ref at wrap: `stash@{0}` (verify with `git stash list`; the numbered
  ref can change if new stashes are added)

Before editing next session, inspect the stash with
`git stash show -u --name-only 18a753e1ed36a1e1556069b918492196895fdc14`.
Apply only when ready to untangle the lanes. Do not pop blindly.

| Lane | Files | Next action |
|---|---|---|
| Daily-report integrity | `src/main.jsx`, `src/dashboard/HomeDashboard.jsx`, six daily views, `tests/static/daily_report_integrity.test.js` | Keep. Land after tree is untangled. App-code only. |
| Superseded duplicate Home card | `src/dashboard/HomeDashboard.jsx`, `src/lib/dailyReportDuplicates*`, `tests/static/daily_report_duplicates_static.test.js` | Drop next session. No Home duplicate card. |
| Broiler dropdown location labels | `src/lib/broilerBatchMeta*`, `src/shared/AdminAddReportModal.jsx`, webform files, `tests/static/broiler_batch_location_dropdowns.test.js` | Keep for later. Display location next to batch name; stored value remains batch name. |
| Duplicate-prevention draft | `supabase-migrations/059_daily_unique_indexes.sql`, `scripts/audit_daily_duplicates.cjs` | Do not apply until data cleanup is approved and done. |

---

## Active Roadmap

1. Replace the weird task-row photo icon with a clearer affordance.
2. Remove `N pending` from the Home farrowing-window line.
3. Untangle the working tree. Drop the superseded Home duplicate-card work.
4. Land Daily-report integrity.
5. Build duplicate prevention:
   - Pre-submit duplicate check/warning on daily forms.
   - DB unique indexes for poultry, pig, layer, cattle, sheep only.
   - Exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
   - No hard unique index for `egg_dailys`.
   - Clean existing PROD duplicates before applying migration `059`.
   - Audit files: `C:\Users\Ronni\cc-research\daily-duplicates-audit\daily-duplicates-prod-2026-05-23T15-12-16Z.{md,json}`.
6. Add broiler batch location labels:
   - Example: `B-26-07 (Schooner 2 & 3)`
   - Example: `B-26-08 (Brooder #2)`
   - Stored value stays the batch label.
7. Plan Delete Visibility + Restore:
   - Soft-delete daily reports.
   - Recently Deleted admin view.
   - Restore flow.
   - Delete notifications.
   - Global audit/activity surface for deleted records.

---

## Locked Decisions

- No Home Dashboard duplicate-report card.
- No routine duplicate-report notification fanout.
- Future duplicate handling should prevent the duplicate before save where
  possible, then use DB constraints where the scope is valid.
- `egg_dailys` gets warning/pre-submit guard only. Its current data does not
  support a safe hard unique scope.
- Deleted records need global visibility because the original tile may no
  longer exist. Per-tile activity is not enough.
- Activity is Podio-style per entity/tile; a separate global audit/recently
  deleted surface is needed for deletes.
- Delete events may belong in Notifications Center because they are operational
  exceptions, not routine duplicate noise.
- CC should not repitch skipped skill installs: UI UX Pro Max, Impeccable/Taste
  for WCF, Stop Slop, GSD, claude-mem for WCF, OpenSpec.

- `viewer`: read-oriented authenticated access.
- Public/anon: documented public webforms only.

### Routes

Authenticated:

- `/` home dashboard
- `/tasks`

### Key Files

| Area | Files |
|---|---|
| App shell | `src/App.jsx`, `src/main.jsx`, `src/shared/Header.jsx` |
| Routes | `src/lib/routes.js` |
| Supabase | `src/lib/supabase.js`, `src/lib/pagination.js` |
| Tasks | `src/tasks/*`, `src/lib/tasks*Api.js`, `src/lib/tasksCenter*Api.js` |

| Public forms | `src/webforms/*` |
| Icons | `src/lib/plannerIcons.js`, `src/components/PlannerIcon.jsx` |
| Offline | `src/lib/offline*.js`, `src/lib/useOffline*.js` |

### Persistence

Hand-created prod tables that test bootstrap must seed before migrations alter
them:

`profiles`, `app_store`, `webform_config`, `poultry_dailys`, `layer_dailys`,
`egg_dailys`, `pig_dailys`, `layer_batches`, `layer_housings`.

Main table groups:

- Daily reports: `poultry_dailys`, `layer_dailys`, `egg_dailys`,
  `pig_dailys`, `cattle_dailys`, `sheep_dailys`.
- Tasks: `task_templates`, `task_instances`, `task_cron_runs`,
  `task_summary_runs`, `task_instance_*`, `task_system_rules`.
- Notifications/activity: `notifications`, `activity_events`,
  `activity_mentions`.
- Livestock: `cattle*`, `sheep*`, `weigh_in_sessions`, `weigh_ins`,
  `layer_batches`, `layer_housings`.
- Equipment/fuel: `equipment*`, `fuel_supplies`, `fuel_bills`,
  `fuel_bill_lines`, `equipment_service_materials`,
  `equipment_material_clears`.

Important `app_store` keys:

- `ppp-v4`: broiler batches.
- `ppp-feeders-v1`: pig feeder groups, sub-batches, planned trips,
  processing trips.
- `ppp-pigs-v1`, `ppp-breeding-v1`, `ppp-farrowing-v1`,
  `ppp-breeders-v1`: pig herd/breeding/farrowing data.
- `ppp-feed-orders-v1`, `ppp-pig-feed-inventory-v1`,
  `ppp-poultry-feed-inventory-v1`: feed planning.
- `ppp-pig-planned-trip-locks-v1`: pig planned-trip lock sidecar.
- `ppp-missed-cleared-v1`, `ppp-webforms-v1`: home/webform support.

Important `webform_config` keys:

- `team_roster`, `team_members`, `team_availability`
- `tasks_public_assignee_availability`
- `broiler_batch_meta`, `housing_batch_map`, `broiler_groups`,
  `active_groups`, `layer_groups`, `full_config`, `webform_settings`

Storage buckets:

- `batch-documents`
- `equipment-maintenance-docs`
- `fuel-bills`
- `daily-photos`
- `task-photos`
- `task-request-photos`

## Load-Bearing Contracts

Read the relevant contract before editing its files.

### Cross-App

- Do not change Supabase auth config in `src/lib/supabase.js` without a plan.
- Keep `wcfSelectAll`; Supabase `.limit()` silently caps at 1000.
- Keep BrowserRouter view-to-URL adapter unless doing a planned router lane.
- Do not introduce `window.confirm`, `window.alert`, or `window.prompt`.
- Use inline notices, `DeleteModal`, or typed confirmation surfaces.
- Public forms must keep no-auth access where documented.
- Netlify redirect order matters: `equipment.html` rules before SPA fallback.
- No migrations, RLS, Vault, Edge Function deploys, or production data actions
  without Ronnie's explicit gate from [HO.md](HO.md).

### Supabase And Storage

- Never delete directly from `storage.objects`; use Storage API list/remove
  recursion.
- Private buckets are read through signed URLs.
- Task photo uploads are append-only (`upsert:false`); duplicate object errors
  are retry success.
- Admin-created user emails, welcome emails, and password resets are sent by
  `rapid-processor` from `noreply@wcfplanner.com`.
- PROD `exec_sql` is forbidden.

### Tasks

- `/tasks` is canonical.
- Task writes go through v2 wrappers/RPCs only.
- Do not directly update `task_instances` or task sidecar tables from UI code.
- Do not call `generate_system_task_instance` from frontend code.
- `task_instance_photos` is canonical; legacy single-path columns are fallback
  display only.
- Header task badge soft-fails to zero and must not break Header rendering.
- Task assignee dropdowns use `loadTaskAssignableProfilesById` and fail closed
  on config read errors.

### Notifications

- Client cannot insert/delete notifications.
- Notification writes happen inside SECURITY DEFINER paths.
- Recipient-only RLS: users can select/update only their own rows.
- Recipient UPDATE grant is column-scoped to `read_at`.
- `complete_task_instance` notification insert must never roll back the task
  completion.
- Skip task-completed notification when creator is null or completer is creator.
- Valid `notifications.type`: `task_completed`, `mention`. New types require a
  migration that widens the CHECK.
- Header bell soft-fails to zero and must not break Header rendering.

### Activity And Mentions

- All activity reads/writes go through SECURITY DEFINER RPCs:
  `list_activity_events`, `count_activity_for_entity`,
  `post_activity_comment`, `edit_activity_event`, `delete_activity_event`.
- No direct `.from('activity_events')` or `.from('activity_mentions')` in
  `src`.
- `_activity_can_read(entity_type, entity_id)` is fail-closed. Entity existence
  is checked before role shortcuts; admin does not bypass fake-id rejection.
- Phase 1 supports only `task.*` entity types. New entity type = one resolver
  branch, one `activityRegistry` entry, and one surface wire-up.
- Mentions use `p_mentions[]` as identity. Visible body stays user-friendly
  plain `@Name`; UUIDs must not appear in body text.
- Server validates mentions: profile exists, profile active, max 10 mentions,
  caller can write. Self-mention records the mention but sends no notification.
- `delete_activity_event` is soft-delete only; author or admin.
- If a SECDEF RPC return shape changes, migration must end with
  `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`.

### Daily Reports

- Add Feed quick-log rows can share daily tables but are not a substitute for a
  full daily report. Missed-report checks exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Duplicate prevention target:
  - poultry/pig/layer: `(date, batch_label)`
  - cattle: `(date, herd)`
  - sheep: `(date, flock)`
  - partial indexes exclude Add Feed rows
  - `egg_dailys`: warning/pre-submit guard only, no hard unique index yet
- Existing PROD duplicate cleanup is required before applying migration `059`.
- Future delete lane should use soft-delete plus global Recently Deleted/Audit;
  hard delete hides evidence operators need.

### Pig

- Feeder group started counts are authoritative.
- Current count is ledger-derived, not persisted `currentCount`.
- Planned-trip row shape stays exactly:
  `{id, date, sex, subBatchId, plannedCount, order}`.
- Lock state lives only in `ppp-pig-planned-trip-locks-v1`.
- `processingTrips[].subAttributions` must be stamped as
  `{subId, subBatchName, sex, count}`.
- Send-to-Trip from `/pig/weighins` may reconcile a locked planned trip count,
  but cannot change the locked date.
- Use `pigSlug` for sub-batch matching.

### Broiler And Layers

- Broiler batches live in `ppp-v4`.
- Public `/weighins` cannot read or mutate `app_store.ppp-v4` directly.
- Public week 4/6 completion uses `stamp_broiler_batch_avg` RPC.
- Do not grant anon direct `app_store` access.
- Admin weigh-in paths may use authenticated `app_store` helpers.
- Layer `current_count` is physical anchor; projected count subtracts
  mortalities since anchor.

### Feed Planning

- Feed math lives in `src/lib/feedPlanner.js`; views should not rebuild it.
- `LEAD_TIME_DAYS = 7`, `RESERVE_DAYS.default = 30`,
  `ORDER_ROUNDING_LBS = 50`, `STALE_SNAPSHOT_DAYS = 21`.
- Feed types: `pig`, `starter`, `grower`, `layerfeed`.
- Snapshot counts are anchors; today's on-hand subtracts consumption since the
  snapshot date.
- Poultry burn uses existing broiler/layer schedule helpers.

### Cattle And Sheep

- Cattle and sheep use dedicated Supabase tables, not `app_store`.
- Cattle herds: `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, `bulls`.
- Sheep flocks: `rams`, `ewes`, `feeders`.
- Cattle processing storage statuses remain `scheduled`, `active`, `complete`;
  UI may label `complete` as Processed.
- Cattle move only when Send-to-Processor promotes a row to `active`.
- `loadCattleWeighInsCached` keeps the two-query pattern. Do not rewrite to
  `!inner`.
- Old cattle tag source strings are load-bearing: `import`, `weigh_in`,
  `manual`.

### Cattle And Sheep Inputs

- Admin panel: `src/admin/LivestockFeedInputsPanel.jsx`.
- Public/new-record dropdowns hide only `status === 'inactive'`; legacy
  blank/null status remains selectable.
- Daily edit/history surfaces must load inactive referenced inputs for snapshot
  rebuilding; filter inactive rows at dropdown render sites, not load time.

### Equipment

- Logged-in Equipment: `/fleet`.
- Public equipment/fueling: `/equipment` and `/equipment/<slug>`.
- Public fueling uses `submit_equipment_fueling` RPC.
- Fuel-log edit/delete paths recompute current readings from remaining fuel logs.
- Equipment checklist/material textboxes must not reload, lose focus, or reorder
  list items on click/edit.
- Rolling materials clears are bucketed by due service cycle.

### Icons

- Use `public/icons/planner` through `PlannerIcon` or `plannerIconUrl`.
- App code must not reference `C:\Users\Ronni\OneDrive\Desktop\planner pics`.
- Do not put images inside `<option>` elements; use text fallback there.
