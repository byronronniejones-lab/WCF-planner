# WCF Planner

Farm-management web app for White Creek Farm. React/Vite single-page app,
Supabase backend, Netlify production deploy from GitHub `main`.

This file is the durable project map: current state, architecture, roadmap, and
load-bearing contracts. Workflow, roles, gates, and relay format live in
[HO.md](HO.md). Do not turn this file into a session transcript.

Last updated: 2026-06-18.
Current shipped runtime checkpoint: `ccacaf3`
(`Merge task notifications hotfix`), with this `PROJECT.md` docs update on top.
Production URL: https://wcfplanner.com.
Latest live bundle verification after `ccacaf3` is pending Netlify deploy
completion.

---

## Start Here

1. Read [HO.md](HO.md) for workflow, roles, gates, relay format, and
   parallel-worktree rules.
2. Read this file's Current State, Build Queue, and the relevant contracts.
3. Run `git status --short`, `git worktree list`, and inspect recent `git log`
   before planning or editing.
4. Inspect the source/test/migration files in scope before changing anything.

Default session model: Codex plans/reviews, CC builds/validates, Ronnie approves
commit/push/PROD gates. Ronnie may explicitly assign Codex build work; otherwise
CC is the primary builder.

## Project Map Governance

This file is a docs-as-code project map, not a session log, scratchpad, or
append-only changelog.

Rules for editing this file:

- Build Queue is the only home for outstanding build/design work. Do not hide
  "future", "needs", "still needs", "TODO", or "TBD" work in later sections.
- Contract sections describe current architecture, standards, and guard rails.
  If a contract is aspirational rather than true, move the work to Build Queue
  and state the current guard/inventory honestly.
- Current State summarizes what is true now, including active local worktree risk
  when it matters. Latest Shipped Checkpoint summarizes work merged to
  `origin/main`.
- Inventory counts, migration state, test names, and owner lists must match the
  source/static guards at the time of edit. Prefer pointing to the guard as the
  source of truth instead of duplicating fragile counts.
- Every Build Queue item should state class (`DEFECT`, `DECISION`, `ENH`),
  scope, success criteria, validation/guard target, and any migration/PROD gate
  once it is promoted into an active lane.
- Remove or reconcile stale text instead of appending corrections nearby.
- Normal build/hotfix lanes must not edit this file unless Ronnie explicitly
  requests docs, wrap, or a named `PROJECT.md` change.

Design/function invariants that govern cross-surface behavior live in
`## Global Decisions (Constitution)` and `## Design System`.

---

## Current State

- Production deploy: Netlify auto-deploys from GitHub `main`.
- Source: `main` / `origin/main` is the docs update that records runtime
  checkpoint `ccacaf3`.
- Extra worktrees:
  - `C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner` on
    `fix/production-reconciliation-audit-collapse` at `8dfb024`, with CC-owned
    local tracked edits. Do not use it for unrelated merge work.
  - `C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner-codex-pasture-map-completion` on `main` at
    the docs update on top of runtime checkpoint `ccacaf3`, with only untracked
    pasture screenshot artifacts.
  - `C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner-codex-hotfix-task-notifications` on
    `codex/hotfix-task-notifications` at `6e6fb7a`, pushed to origin and merged
    into `main`.
  - `C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner-codex-compact-controls` on
    `codex/compact-list-controls`.
  - `C:\Users\Ronni\WCF-planner-pasture-cp2` on
    `feature/pasture-map-cp2-draw-edit`.
- Open gates: `tasks-cron` Edge Function deploy is pending for the task
  notification hotfix. PROD migration `133` is applied. No Storage/Vault gate is
  open.
  Pasture Map designer feedback is pending and should be uploaded at the start
  of the next session before any pasture-map build prompt is written.
- Local untracked artifacts in the main worktree:
  `pasture-cp2-shots/`, `pasture-data-mock-shots/`, and
  `pasture-map-shots/`. They are not staged or part of shipped code.
- PROD-applied recent migrations include `112` through `116`, `125`, `126`,
  `127`, `128`, `129`, `130`, `131`, and `132`. `116` (Pasture Map CP1),
  `125` (Production legacy events), and `126` (breeding-pig Activity entity)
  were applied to PROD on 2026-06-15. `127` (Pasture Map draw/edit RPCs) was
  applied to PROD on 2026-06-16. Pasture Map `128`-`132` artifacts were verified
  present on TEST and PROD by catalog checks on 2026-06-17. Migration `133`
  (task system generation support and To Do approval notifications) was applied
  to TEST on 2026-06-17 and PROD on 2026-06-18.
- Production legacy import: `Processing Events - ALL.xlsx` parsed 69 rows,
  skipped 0, and upserted 69 rows into `production_legacy_events` on PROD by
  stable `source_key`.
- Pasture Map PROD state: CP1-CP7 schema/RPC support is present for import,
  draw/edit, move ledger, planned moves, reports, field GPS tracks, line style,
  and line patterns/defaults. Land areas are created/reviewed through
  `/pasture-map`; no fake pasture seed data is required.
- Latest validation after the task notification hotfix: `npm run format:check`
  green; targeted static task/notification tests green (131 tests);
  hotfix-touched lint green; `npm run build` green with existing Vite
  dynamic-import/chunk warnings; authenticated To Do approval Playwright flow
  green on TEST (5 tests) after applying migration `133` to TEST. PROD migration
  `133` applied with `psql --single-transaction` and post-apply catalog checks
  on 2026-06-18. Full lint and full Vitest still report unrelated pre-existing
  failures in pasture/pig/global activity areas.
- `npm install` was run in the main worktree after Pasture Map dependencies
  landed. It reported npm audit findings (11 vulnerabilities: 1 low, 3
  moderate, 6 high, 1 critical). No audit-fix lane has been scoped.

### Latest Shipped Checkpoint

The following work is merged to `main` and pushed. Netlify deploys from `main`;
latest live-bundle verification is pending where noted above.

- Task notifications hotfix:
  - `tasks-cron` still generates recurring template tasks and now also generates
    eligible system tasks from active `task_system_rules`.
  - System task generation reads the real planner stores:
    `ppp-v4`, `ppp-feeders-v1`, `ppp-breeding-v1`, and `ppp-farrowing-v1`.
  - `lead_time_days` controls when a system task is minted; `due_date` remains
    the actual farm event date.
  - To Do completion submitted by non-managers now notifies management/admin
    that approval is waiting.
  - Whoever created a To Do is notified when completion is approved or
    auto-approved.
  - Migration `133` is TEST- and PROD-applied; Edge Function deploy remains
    gated.
- Site-wide Home aesthetic parity rollout:
  - Foundation/global token layer and shared openable hover primitives.
  - Admin, activity, webforms, equipment, Task Center, To Do, cattle, sheep, pig,
    broiler, layer, and livestock parity slices.
  - Program identity colors remain small accents; broad pastel fills were
    reduced where scoped. Green Header chrome remains.
  - Guard repairs closed stale assumptions around z-index, task photo ownership,
    My Submissions, webforms, record-page shell, and openable hover.
- Site-wide UI cleanup core and DataTable conversion:
  - Merge PR #9 (`59bc089`) shipped canonical primitives: `DataTable`, `Badge`,
    `StatusText`, `EmptyState`, `OperationalListEmptyState`, `SectionBand`,
    `Toolbar`, and `Tabs`. Program accents come from
    `src/lib/programColors.js`.
  - Ordinary operational text tightened to true black for primary titles,
    labels, row values, buttons, and main numbers; supporting metadata stays
    muted gray.
  - Radius floor is active: UI element radii must be at least `10px`; values
    `1`-`9` are retired except explicit decorative `radius-allow` carve-outs
    and the ratified `.home.theme-crisp` island.
  - Merge PR #10 (`be63b96` / `9d22fab`) converted the 12 named list surfaces
    from faux cards/grids to shared `DataTable`: broiler/cattle/pig/layer/egg/
    sheep dailys, cattle herds, sheep flocks, breeding pigs, and cattle/sheep/
    livestock weigh-ins.
  - Rows are real `<tr>` `.hoverable-row` openables with keyboard row-open,
    fail-closed loading/error/empty states, and mobile stacked record-lines.
- Cattle forecast mobile overflow:
  - Merge PR #14 (`9647d55` / `819d285`) wraps the wide forecast chart, month,
    and past-actual tables in local horizontal scroll so the page does not force
    body-level overflow on mobile.
- Feed-order month hotfix:
  - Pig and broiler feed boards use the same calendar-pinned order-month rule.
  - "Order for `<month>`" stays on the next calendar month until the calendar
    advances; saving an order no longer rolls the board to the following month.
  - Source owner: `src/lib/feedOrderBasis.js` (`calendarOrderYM`).
- Breeding pigs parity:
  - Breeding pigs are table-based by group, not modal/card Record-button tiles.
  - Table rows open `/pig/sows/<id>` with hover affordance.
  - Breeding-pig record pages mount Comments + Activity via `pig.breeder`.
  - Migration `126` adds `pig.breeder` to the Activity read/write resolver and
    is PROD-applied.
- Animals on Farm snapshot hotfix:
  - Home uses the shared current animal snapshot logic and no longer carries the
    stale layer-count import.
  - Animals on Farm page remains the monthly history/detail view.
- Production page:
  - Home Production card opens `/production`.
  - No combined total exists anywhere; totals are per program only.
  - Year-over-year values are per program/year.
  - Visible page language is production reporting, not import/audit
    reconciliation. The page shows Summary and Production Events; no visible
    Reconciliation/Audit tab, source split, Planner-vs-backfill split, Podio
    terminology, Raw-Podio columns, or delta-vs-Podio columns.
  - Production data auto-updates from Planner sources plus historical backfill.
    The reconciliation rule is internal: Planner wins by program/year coverage;
    historical rows count only for program/years with no Planner events.
  - Light users are excluded from `/production`.
  - Migration `125` and the 69-row legacy import are PROD-applied.
- Pig weigh-ins:
  - Pig weigh-in record pages render entries as dense tables, not card/badge
    grids.
  - The send-to-trip control is the leftmost row checkbox; the existing
    `Send N to Trip` modal/action flow is preserved.
  - `/pig/weighins` is split into Active and Complete sections. Pig list saved
    views, CSV export, Print, and status filters are removed. Broiler weigh-ins
    keep the shared saved-view/export/print/filter behavior.
- Pasture Map:
  - Home shows a Pasture Map button beside Weather above Processing/Admin.
  - `/pasture-map` renders the map/import/draw/edit/measure surface plus move
    ledger, occupancy/rest display, planned moves, reports, offline vector queue,
    GPS field tracks, and line-style/pattern controls.
  - Client parses OnX KML with `@tmcw/togeojson`; Polygons import as reviewable
    areas; LineStrings import as outline candidates and are never auto-closed.
  - Read access starts at `farm_team`; management/admin can import/classify/
    close/delete and draw/edit geometry. Farm-team users can view, measure,
    record moves, and create GPS tracks. Light users are excluded.
  - Map rendering uses Leaflet with USGS/NAIP imagery. Geometry is provider-
    neutral GeoJSON/PostGIS; Google is not the geometry source.
  - Draw/edit uses Leaflet-Geoman with snapping, a measure HUD, client
    self-intersection warnings, and DB-side validity checks.
  - Geometry edits are append-only versions and preserve manual acreage override
    separately from computed geodesic acreage.
  - Baseline/no-history pastures render solid gray by default; dashed styling is
    reserved for semantic review/problem states or explicit saved line patterns.
  - Migrations `116`, `127`, `128`, `129`, `130`, `131`, and `132` are present on
    TEST and PROD. Offline imagery cache is not built; vector/cache/queue
    behavior is present.

## Build Queue

Treat these as product lanes, not hotfixes, unless Ronnie says otherwise.
This is the canonical home for outstanding build/design work.

1. Pasture Map One-Page Planning/Field Redesign
   - Class: `DECISION`/`ENH`.
   - Status: consensus questions are answered; designer feedback is pending and
     should be uploaded at the start of the next session before CC receives a
     build prompt.
   - Primary job: combined pasture tool with grazing planning/rest tracking/
     rotation decisions as the main purpose.
   - Primary users: Nick in the office reviewing/planning; farm team in the
     field executing the plan on phones.
   - Keep `/pasture-map` as one page, reorganized into clear modes/tabs rather
     than separate routes. Default must be neutral view/map/select, not the
     current animal-move entry mode.
   - Required IA direction: View/Map, Plan, Field, Setup, and Reports. Reports
     stay available but deeper/collapsed so map + planning stay primary.
   - Required field direction: offline use is mandatory; the map is not useful
     without bad-service field execution. Field mode needs large controls,
     trustworthy queue/sync state, `My Location`, `Fit Farm`, and
     `Zoom Selected`.
   - Visual rules: automatic grazing-state colors win; manual line styling must
     not override the main occupancy/rest/status meaning. Include a collapsible
     legend for colors/dashes/statuses.
   - Terminology: rename toolbar `Move` to `Map` or `Pan`; reserve "Move" for
     animal-move actions. Rename `Track` to `Trace` or `GPS Boundary`; rename
     `Edit` to `Edit Boundary`.
   - Imagery/zoom: current USGS/NAIP imagery is not good enough, but Google
     Earth quality is more than required. Use automatic sharper online imagery
     when available (likely Esri World Imagery after terms/attribution check),
     fall back to NAIP/USGS/offline-compatible behavior, no manual basemap
     switcher, allow over-zoom even if blurry, and prevent blank/broken tile
     requests. Empirical probe at WCF showed USGS tiles 200 through z16 and 404
     at z17-z22 while Esri returned tiles through z22.
   - Validation targets: `tests/static/pasture_map_static.test.js`,
     `src/lib/pastureGeometry.test.js`, `src/lib/pastureKml.test.js`,
     pasture Playwright specs relevant to changed workflows, mobile/no-overflow
     checks, and build. Add/update guards for mode labels, default mode,
     provider fallback, and no exposed setup/reporting clutter in field mode.
   - Gate: code-only unless imagery provider work introduces API keys, terms,
     billing, storage/offline cache, or DB/RPC changes. Any PROD migration,
     Storage, Vault, or paid provider key remains an explicit Ronnie gate.

2. Parity Residuals
   - Class: `ENH`.
   - Known small follow-ups from the parity rollout:
      cattle herd-color owner reconciliation and SheepDailysView flock row-badge
      residual.
    - Home quick-nav tiles still need a narrow-phone fix: `.home .tile` is
      missing `min-width: 0`, which can let quick-nav tiles overflow at
      `<=375px`.
    - HomeDashboard admin Last-5-Days mobile/responsive cleanup is merged.
      Cattle forecast mobile-scroll cleanup is merged.
   - Scope each separately; do not reopen a full site-wide parity pass without a
     new audit.
   - Gate: code-only unless a touched surface needs a guard update.

3. Dependency Audit Lane
   - Class: `DEFECT`/`ENH`.
   - Scope: review `npm audit` findings after the 2026-06-15 dependency install.
   - Success criteria: identify direct vs transitive vulnerabilities, decide
     safe upgrades, avoid breaking Vite/React/Supabase/Playwright toolchain.
   - Gate: code/dependency lockfile push; no PROD DB work expected.

## Global Decisions (Constitution)

The following decisions are locked and govern future builds. New code and
surface changes MUST conform unless this section is amended.

Rules:

- No surface may silently diverge from a locked decision. New exceptions MUST be
  added to `## Intentional Non-Uniformities` with justification.
- Changing any locked decision requires a Ronnie-approved amendment in this file
  and the relevant guard update in the same change.
- The entire `## Design System` section is part of the Constitution.

| Decision | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Font scale | Ratified; shared-token enforcement active, residual legacy drift only by scoped lane | `design_token_contract_static.test.js`, `record_page_shell_static.test.js` |
| Button corners | Ratified; 10px radius floor active; `1`-`9` retired except explicit decorative carve-outs | `design_token_contract_static.test.js`, `radius_floor_static.test.js` |
| Confirm/Delete stacking | Ratified; top destructive overlay tier | `design_token_contract_static.test.js`, `shared_ui_extraction_contract_static.test.js` |
| Button height/padding | Ratified; standard button pad `10px 16px` | `design_token_contract_static.test.js` |
| Save model | Ratified; submit-style vs autosave split | `save_model_contract_static.test.js` |
| Ordinary text hierarchy | Ratified; cleanup-core true-black tightening shipped | `index.html`, `src/shared/DataTable.css`, `design_token_contract_static.test.js` |

Locked functional invariants:

| Invariant | Contract section | Guard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single Supabase client owner; no unapproved browser secrets | Cross-App Rules | `supabase_client_owner_static.test.js`, `browser_secret_boundary_static.test.js` |
| Permissions enforced by RLS/RPC, never UI alone | Authentication And Roles | `light_user_portal_static.test.js` and per-surface guards |
| Route aliases only in `src/lib/routes.js` | Route Ownership | `url_alias_redirects.spec.js` |
| Fail-closed loading order | Cold-Boot And Fail-Closed Loading | `load_retry_robustness_inventory_static.test.js` |
| Audit-critical mutations through SECDEF RPCs | Entity Mutations And Audit Atomicity | `mutation_semantics_inventory_static.test.js` |
| Daily edits/deletes through ownership RPCs | Daily Reports | `cp2_daily_writes_via_rpc_static.test.js` |
| One canonical component per UI role | Shared UI And Record Chrome | `shared_ui_extraction_contract_static.test.js` |

---

## Intentional Non-Uniformities

These differences are current product/architecture decisions, not parity defects
unless Ronnie changes the contract:

- Light users are intentionally excluded from `/weighins`, `/production`, and
  `/pasture-map`.
- Light users may access Cattle Log through the webform/field-journal path.
- Migration `083` public webform submitter identity stays shelved. Authenticated
  submitter identity is the durable path.
- `/webform-pigs` remains a valid legacy standalone pig daily form route/alias.
- `egg_dailys` has warning/pre-submit duplicate prevention only; it is not
  covered by the daily unique-index backstop.
- Add Feed quick-log rows are not full daily reports, and missed-report checks
  exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Broiler, layer, and pig daily pages use Group copy rather than Batch copy.
- Pig planned-trip forecast weights are render-only. Latest weigh-ins do not
  change planned-trip forecast weights automatically.
- Program dashboards may show program-specific KPIs.
- The public `#webform-container` CSS island is intentionally separate from the
  React app tokens.
- The homepage redesign remains scoped under `.home.theme-crisp`; do not move
  Home-specific non-canonical micro-values globally without an amendment.
- `getReadableText()` in `src/lib/styles.js` returns infrastructure contrast
  colors for arbitrary colored backgrounds; this is not palette drift.

---

## Product Surface

### Authenticated App

- Home dashboard: `.home.theme-crisp` landing surface with label-only program
  tiles, Pasture Map + Weather field row, Processing/Admin utility row, Animals
  on Farm, Production, missed-daily/equipment/material alerts, Next 30 Days, and
  admin Last-5-Days.
- `/animals-on-farm`: newest-first monthly species counts and multi-series line
  graph for Broilers, Layer Hens, Pigs, Cattle, Sheep, and Total. History range
  starts Oct 2024.
- `/production`: per-program production totals, per-program YoY, and production
  events. Internal reconciliation prevents double-counting historical backfill,
  but the visible page is production reporting, not audit/import review. No
  combined total ever.
- `/pasture-map`: field map/planning surface for OnX KML import, land-area
  review, classification, outline close, draw/edit/snap/measure, acreage
  display, GPS locate, NAIP imagery, move ledger/current occupancy, planned
  moves, rest/history/stocking reports, offline vector queue, GPS field tracks,
  and line-style/pattern controls.
- Broiler: home, timeline, batches, feed, dailys, weigh-ins.
- Pig: home, breeding, farrowing, breeding pigs, batches, feed, dailys,
  weigh-ins with table-based session records and Active/Complete list sections.
- Layer: home, groups, batches, dailys, eggs.
- Cattle: home, herds, breeding, forecast, processing batches, dailys,
  weigh-ins, Cattle Log.
- Sheep: home, flocks, processing batches, dailys, weigh-ins.
- Equipment/Fleet: `/fleet` with fleet list, fuel log, and equipment detail;
  `/equipment` remains the login-gated fueling/checklist hub.
- Task Center: `/tasks`, with To Do List at `/tasks/todo` and record pages at
  `/tasks/todo/<id>`.
- Light portal: contained home for `role=light`, allowed webform/daily
  shortcuts, Tasks, My Submissions/View Past Reports, equipment public hub, fuel
  supply, Add Feed, legacy pig daily, and Cattle Log. No Production, Pasture Map,
  or Weigh-ins.
- Global Activity: `/activity`.
- Admin/config: `/admin`.
- Admin runtime observability: `/admin/client-errors`.

### Login-Gated Form URLs

- Former public report/form URLs are authenticated. Existing paths and aliases
  stay valid, redirect logged-out users to login, and return to the requested URL
  after auth.
- `/dailys` and `/dailys/tasks`.
- `/addfeed`.
- `/weighins`.
- `/equipment` and `/equipment/<slug>`.
- `/fuel-supply`.
- `/webform-pigs`.
- Legacy aliases redirect through `src/lib/routes.js`.

### Operational Record Pages

Record pages are durable per-entity workspaces. They own record details,
Comments, collapsed Activity log, sequence navigation where appropriate, and
fail-closed loading.

Live Activity entity types and routes:

| Entity type | Route |
| --- | --- |
| `task.instance` | `/tasks/<id>` |
| `todo.item` | `/tasks/todo/<id>` |
| `cattle.animal` | `/cattle/herds/<id>` |
| `sheep.animal` | `/sheep/flocks/<id>` |
| `cattle.processing` | `/cattle/batches/<id>` |
| `sheep.processing` | `/sheep/batches/<id>` |
| `broiler.batch` | `/broiler/batches/<encoded name>` |
| `pig.batch` | `/pig/batches/<group id>` |
| `pig.breeder` | `/pig/sows/<id>` |
| `layer.batch` | `/layer/batches/<id>` |
| `layer.housing` | `/layer/housings/<id>` |
| `equipment.item` | `/fleet/<id>` |
| `poultry.daily` | `/broiler/dailys/<id>` |
| `layer.daily` | `/layer/dailys/<id>` |
| `egg.daily` | `/layer/eggs/<id>` |
| `pig.daily` | `/pig/dailys/<id>` |
| `cattle.daily` | `/cattle/dailys/<id>` |
| `sheep.daily` | `/sheep/dailys/<id>` |
| `weighin.session` | `/weigh-in-sessions/<id>` |
| `cattle.forecast` | `/cattle/forecast` |
| `cattle.breeding` | `/cattle/breeding` |
| `cattle.log` | `/cattle/log` |

No operational record workspace should reintroduce legacy `ActivityPanel` or
`ActivityModal`. Comments are discussion; Activity is audit/history.

---

## Backend And Data State

### Stack

- React 18 / Vite SPA.
- Supabase JS client from `src/lib/supabase.js` only.
- React Router DOM.
- `idb` for IndexedDB/offline queue.
- Leaflet for Pasture Map rendering; Leaflet-Geoman powers draw/edit/snap
  controls.
- Vitest for unit/static tests.
- Playwright for e2e.
- ESLint + Prettier.
- Netlify production deploy from `main`.

### Supabase Migrations

Current PROD architecture includes all applied migrations through `116`, plus
`125`, `126`, `127`, `128`, `129`, `130`, `131`, `132`, and `133`. Recent
load-bearing migrations:

- `100` processing batch lifecycle RPCs.
- `101`-`104` audited delete RPCs and hardening.
- `105` recurring task template creation RPC.
- `106` delete layer batch RPC.
- `107` delete fuel bill RPC.
- `108` delete feed input RPC.
- `109` drop dead daily-photo anon insert policy.
- `110` cattle calf-row heifer promotion.
- `111` weigh-in note -> canonical comment mirror.
- `112` cattle log sidecar tables/RPCs/triggers.
- `113` Light daily report 3-day own-record edit/delete window.
- `114` task photo 5-total DB backstop.
- `115` Task Center To Do List schema/RPCs/photos/mentions/digest fields.
- `116` Pasture Map CP1:
  - `pasture_import_batches`, self-referencing `land_areas`, and append-only
    `land_area_geometry_versions`.
  - PostGIS in `extensions` schema; geometry stored as 4326; acreage via
    `ST_Area(geom::geography)`.
  - Deny-all RLS; access only through SECURITY DEFINER RPCs.
  - `list_land_areas` read gate: `farm_team`, `management`, `admin`.
  - Import/classify/close/delete gates: `management`, `admin`.
  - OnX UUID becomes `source_external_id`; re-import updates, not duplicates.
  - Polygons import as `unclassified`/`pending_review`; LineStrings import as
    `outline_candidate`; no auto-close; invalid polygons are flagged, not fixed.
  - No fabricated last-grazed date; `baseline_no_history` is distinct.
- `125` Production legacy events:
  - `production_legacy_events` table with deny-all RLS.
  - `list_production_legacy_events(date,date)` SECURITY DEFINER read RPC.
  - Read gate: `farm_team`, `management`, `admin`; Light excluded.
  - Spreadsheet importer upserts by stable `source_key`; 69 rows imported to
    PROD on 2026-06-15.
- `126` Breeding-pig Activity entity:
  - Adds `pig.breeder` to `_activity_can_read` / `_activity_can_write`.
  - Existence check is `app_store` key `ppp-breeders-v1`, object id match.
  - Program access gate is `pig`.
- `127` Pasture Map CP2 draw/edit:
  - Adds `create_land_area(text,text,jsonb,text,text)` and
    `update_land_area_geometry(text,jsonb)` SECURITY DEFINER RPCs.
  - Management/admin only; EXECUTE granted to `authenticated` and revoked from
    `PUBLIC`/`anon`.
  - Reuses `_land_area_add_version`; edits append a new geometry version and
    stamp version source as `drawn`, while preserving the original area source
    in raw payload.
  - Validates polygon/multipolygon GeoJSON and rejects invalid/self-
    intersecting geometry; acreage remains geodesic.
  - PROD-applied on 2026-06-16 with schema reload and structural/PostgREST anon
    permission smokes. No PROD land-area rows were created.
- `133` task system generation support and To Do approval notifications:
  - Widens `notifications_type_check` for `todo_completion_submitted`.
  - Reissues `submit_todo_completion` so non-manager completion submissions
    notify management/admin while approval and auto-approval still notify the
    To Do creator.
  - TEST-applied on 2026-06-17; PROD-applied on 2026-06-18.
- `128` Pasture Map CP3 move ledger / occupancy / rest:
  - Adds `pasture_move_events`, `pasture_move_impacts`,
    `_land_area_current_geom`, `_pasture_move_summary`, updated
    `_land_area_summary`, `list_pasture_moves`, and `record_pasture_move`.
  - Move impacts track destination/departure/overlap. Grazing state and current
    occupants are derived from dated move events.
- `129` Pasture Map CP4 planning/reports:
  - Adds `pasture_planned_moves`, planned-move create/list/status RPCs, and
    history/rest/stocking report RPCs.
- `130` Pasture Map CP6 field GPS tracks:
  - Adds `create_land_area_track` for farm-team/management/admin field-created
    outline candidates from GPS LineStrings.
- `131` Pasture Map CP7 line style:
  - Adds line color/weight support and manager/admin style update RPCs.
- `132` Pasture Map line patterns/defaults:
  - Adds `line_pattern`, solid/dashed/dotted validation, default imported OnX
    line styling, default field-track styling, and
    `update_land_area_line_style`.
  - Verified TEST and PROD artifacts present on 2026-06-17 by catalog checks.

Special migration notes:

- `082` is intentionally unused.
- `083` public webform submitter identity is shelved.
- `085` was applied before `084` in PROD so duplicate active daily identities
  were cleaned up before unique indexes.
- `061_daily_report_soft_delete_restore.sql` is superseded by `067`.
- New or changed SECDEF RPC return shapes need `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`.
- PROD `exec_sql` is forbidden. Apply PROD SQL with `psql` and
  `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` per [HO.md](HO.md).

### Storage Buckets And Media

Known document/photo surfaces are locked by static guards:

- `daily-photos`.
- `task-photos`.
- `task-request-photos`.
- `comment-photos`.
- `equipment-maintenance-docs`.
- `fuel-bills`.
- `cattle-feed-pdfs`.
- `batch-documents`.

Append-only upload expectations:

- Uploads use `upsert: false` unless a lane explicitly changes the contract.
- Duplicate-object errors are treated as retry success where the upload path is
  idempotent.
- Private buckets use signed URLs; public buckets use public URLs.
- No code should mutate `storage.objects` directly.

### Route Ownership

- `src/lib/routes.js` owns canonical paths and legacy aliases.
- `src/lib/activityRegistry.js` owns entity-to-record routes for Activity and
  notifications.
- `main.jsx` adapts URLs into view state. Do not add separate alias maps in
  views.

### Authentication And Roles

- Ronnie remains final gate owner.
- App roles include `admin`, `management`, `farm_team`, `equipment_tech`,
  `light`, and `inactive`.
- Runtime permission decisions must be enforced by RLS/RPCs, not just hidden UI.
- Report/form submission is login-required. The session user is the submitter;
  `owner_profile_id` is stamped server-side and client-supplied profile IDs are
  not trusted.
- Light allowlist excludes `/production`, `/pasture-map`, `/weighins`, program
  dashboards, `/fleet`, `/activity`, `/admin`, and client-error review.

## Design System

### Typography

- Canonical font family: self-hosted `Hanken Grotesk`.
- Canonical font-size set: `10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 26`.
- Allowed display sizes: `32, 34, 36, 48, 56`.
- Canonical shared-component font-weight scale: `400, 500, 600, 700`.

### Color Hierarchy

- Ordinary main text uses pure black (`#000000`): primary section/card/row
  titles, labels, buttons, and primary animal or production numbers.
- Supporting text uses muted gray: helper copy, subtext, metadata, secondary
  labels, and non-primary category labels.
- Intentional accent/semantic text remains allowed where color carries meaning:
  warning/error/success/info states, weather rain/freeze cues, overdue labels,
  and text inside approved semantic pastel blocks.
- A text-color cleanup must be typography-only unless the build explicitly says
  it is redesigning the affected block's background.

### Spacing And Controls

- Standard button pad is `10px 16px`.
- Standard button vertical pad is `10px`.
- React app inputs/selects/textareas use the 10px radius floor, border
  `1px #d1d5db`, comfortable padding, and brand focus treatment.

### Radius

- Site-wide UI radius floor is `10px`. Canonical rounded values are `10`, `12`,
  `14`, `999`, and `'50%'`; `0` is allowed for intentionally square edges.
- Values `1`-`9` are retired for UI elements. Decorative sub-components may keep
  a smaller radius only when the line is explicitly tagged `radius-allow`; the
  ratified `.home.theme-crisp` island keeps its scoped `9/12/18` values.
- New sub-10px control/card/row radii require a Ronnie-approved amendment and a
  matching guard update.

### Stacking And Elevation

- Dialog layer order keeps Confirm/Delete at toast `9000`; other overlays and
  modals remain below that tier in the shared z-index ladder.

### Save Model

- Explicit Save/Submit by surface class is mandatory for submit-style flows.
- Autosave is mandatory for edit-in-place flows.

### Canonical Components

- Use canonical role owners before introducing equivalent alternatives.
- Canonical owners include `RecordPageShell`, `RecordSequenceNav`,
  `recordPageControls`, `DeleteModal`, `ConfirmModal`, `InlineNotice`, and
  record collaboration primitives.
- Canonical list/data owners include `DataTable`, `Badge`, `StatusText`,
  `EmptyState`, `OperationalListEmptyState`, `SectionBand`, `Toolbar`, `Tabs`,
  and `programColors`.
- `DataTable` is the default owner for row-comparable list surfaces. It owns the
  real table, mobile stacked row, load/error/empty, Active/Complete band, and
  keyboard row-open behavior.

---

## Load-Bearing Contracts

### Cross-App Rules

- Do not bypass RLS with client-side assumptions.
- Do not add browser secrets beyond approved `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`,
  `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and approved dev/test flags.
- Do not create new Supabase clients outside `src/lib/supabase.js`.
- Do not use raw browser `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt` in product surfaces.
- Do not add route aliases outside `src/lib/routes.js`.
- Do not edit docs during normal build/hotfix lanes unless Ronnie explicitly
  asks for docs or wrap work.

### Cold-Boot And Fail-Closed Loading

Data surfaces must fail closed on load errors:

- Record pages render in this order: loading -> loadError -> not-found -> record.
- List/hub surfaces expose `data-<surface>-loaded` markers and gate rows/empty
  states behind `!loadError`.
- Load failures clear stale rows/state, show `InlineNotice`, and should provide a
  user-gated Retry.
- Sidecar reads may degrade best-effort only when the primary record/list load
  is valid.
- Header badge counts soft-fail; Header panel content fails closed.

### Activity, Comments, Mentions, Notifications

- Activity is audit/system history. Comments are user discussion.
- Runtime Activity access goes through SECDEF RPCs: `list_activity_events`,
  `list_global_activity`, `record_activity_event`, and domain-specific SECDEF
  RPCs that insert `activity_events`.
- No direct client `.from('activity_events')`, `.from('activity_mentions')`,
  `.from('comments')`, or `.from('comment_edits')`.
- Legacy Activity composer/count RPCs remain retired; do not use them.
- `RecordActivityLog` filters `comment.posted` and shows audit only.
- `CommentsSection` owns discussion, attachments, edit history, soft delete, and
  mentions.
- Mention bodies stay human-readable `@Name`; UUIDs do not appear in body text.
- Mention notifications route to the operational record page and target comment.
- Valid notification types: `task_completed`, `mention`, `comment_mention`,
  `todo_completion_approved`, `todo_completion_rejected`, `todo_converted`, and
  `todo_completion_submitted`.
- Notification writes happen inside SECDEF paths; client code must not insert or
  delete notifications.

### Activity Entity Additions

A new Activity entity requires all of this:

- SQL `_activity_can_read` branch.
- `activityRegistry` entry.
- Route/deep-link mapping.
- Permission and existence semantics.
- Record or workflow surface.
- Static test coverage.
- Activity/event logging strategy.

Workflow/worktable entities:

- `cattle.forecast` uses entity_id `cattle-forecast`; Forecast month bucket logs
  filter by `payload.month_key`.
- `cattle.breeding` uses entity_id `cattle-breeding`.
- These are table/workflow audit streams and are program-gated rather than
  row-existence gated.

### Entity Mutations And Audit Atomicity

- `runMutation` is for routine client-side mutations with best-effort Activity.
- `runMutation` must not know table names or business rules.
- `runMutation` is not transactional.
- Audit-critical delete/restore/transfer/status flows should move to SECDEF RPCs
  that mutate data and insert Activity in one transaction.
- Mutation inventory counts live in
  `mutation_semantics_inventory_static.test.js`.

### Delete, Restore, And Recovery

- Hard-delete owner inventory lives in `hard_delete_owner_static.test.js`.
- Soft-delete protected roots must not have direct client deletes: cattle,
  sheep, `cattle_dailys`, `sheep_dailys`, `poultry_dailys`, `layer_dailys`,
  `egg_dailys`, `pig_dailys`.
- Daily reports soft-delete through `soft_delete_daily_report` and restore
  through `restore_daily_report`.
- Cattle/sheep animals soft-delete/restore through their animal RPCs.
- Calving sub-row delete goes through `delete_cattle_calving_record`.

### Production

- Production means processed animals and eggs, not current inventory.
- There is no combined production total. Home and `/production` display per-
  program totals only.
- `/production` is a production reporting surface, not an import reconciliation
  workspace. Visible page language should be totals/events by program and year;
  do not expose Planner-vs-backfill/source-split/audit framing in the primary
  page.
- Production sources:
  - Broilers from `app_store.ppp-v4` processed/auto-processed batches.
  - Pigs from `app_store.ppp-feeders-v1.processingTrips`.
  - Cattle from `cattle_processing_batches.actual_process_date`.
  - Sheep from `sheep_processing_batches.actual_process_date`.
  - Eggs from `egg_dailys` counts, displayed as dozens.
  - Legacy backfill from `production_legacy_events`.
- Internal reconciliation: Planner wins by program/year coverage. If Planner has
  events for a program/year, Planner is the counted total and every legacy row
  for that same program/year is held out internally, including rows that
  represent the same batch dated differently. If Planner has no events for a
  program/year, legacy rows count as historical backfill.
- `/production` must not display Podio terminology, Raw-Podio columns, or
  delta-vs-Podio columns. It also must not display a visible Reconciliation tab,
  Legacy/Audit Review panel, source split, Held out, or Conflict columns.
- YoY is per program/year, not across programs.
- Light users are excluded by route allowlist and RPC role gate.

### Pasture Map

- Pasture Map architecture is provider-neutral: GeoJSON/PostGIS owns geometry;
  Leaflet renders the client map; OnX KML and drawn polygons are input sources;
  Google is not the geometry source.
- `land_areas` is the single self-referencing land model. It can represent
  pasture > paddock and feeder-pig area > section > paddock.
- Geometry history is append-only in `land_area_geometry_versions`; editing a
  boundary writes a new version instead of mutating history.
- Species is decoupled from land. `designation` is only a hint; animal-group
  occupancy belongs to dated move events in `pasture_move_events`.
- Imported/drawn land starts `baseline_no_history=true`; no fake last-grazed
  date is seeded.
- LineStrings are outline candidates and require human close/validation. Never
  auto-close an OnX LineString.
- Computed acreage is geodesic; note/manual acreage is cross-check/override, not
  geometry truth. Editing geometry must not overwrite manual acreage override.
- Draw/edit controls use Leaflet-Geoman. Snapping, live area/perimeter measure,
  and client self-intersection warnings are UI requirements; the migration `127`
  RPC validity gates are the database backstop.
- Access: `farm_team`, `management`, `admin` can read/view/measure; only
  `management` and `admin` can import/classify/close/delete/draw/edit/style
  boundaries; `farm_team`, `management`, and `admin` can record pasture moves
  and create GPS field tracks; `light`, `equipment_tech`, and inactive are
  excluded.
- Current Pasture Map includes move ledger, occupancy/rest coloring, planned
  moves, history/rest/stocking reports, offline vector snapshot/queue, GPS field
  tracks, and line styling/pattern controls. It does not include offline imagery
  cache or daily-report wiring.
- Baseline/no-history pastures render solid by default. Dashed strokes are
  reserved for outline candidates, invalid/retired states, GPS field tracks, or
  explicit saved line patterns.
- The next Pasture Map lane is a UX/product redesign, not foundational schema
  bring-up. Preserve the shipped provider-neutral geometry/RPC model unless a
  new Ronnie-approved decision explicitly reopens it.

### Daily Reports

- Daily reports have dedicated record pages for poultry, layer, egg, pig, cattle,
  and sheep.
- All six open directly editable; no edit-mode toggle.
- Daily duplicate prevention is DB-backed for poultry/pig/layer/cattle/sheep by
  partial unique indexes (`084`) after cleanup (`085`); egg duplicate prevention
  is warning/pre-submit only.
- Add Feed quick-log rows are not full daily reports.
- Missed-report checks exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Daily edits route through `updateDailyReport` / `update_daily_report`.
- Daily deletes route through `soft_delete_daily_report`.
- Light can edit/delete only own rows inside the server-side window.

### Cattle And Sheep

- Cattle and sheep use dedicated Supabase tables, not `app_store`.
- Active cattle herds: `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, `bulls`.
- Active sheep flocks: `rams`, `ewes`, `feeders`.
- Outcome states are `processed`, `deceased`, `sold`.
- Heifer-to-cow promotion fires from both calving records and calf-row dam links.
- Manual transfer goes through `transfer_cattle_animal` /
  `transfer_sheep_animal`.
- Processing-batch unschedule/delete go through audited SECDEF RPCs
  `unschedule_cattle_processing_batch` / `delete_sheep_processing_batch`.
- Cattle Log (`/cattle/log`) is a comment-backed program field journal on the
  singleton `cattle.log` entity. It supports keyword search, @mentions, photo
  attachments, offline create replay, issue filters, and #tag mirrors.

### Pig

- Pig feeder group started counts are authoritative.
- Current count is ledger-derived, not persisted `currentCount`.
- `pig.batch` record pages own metadata, sub-batches, mortality, planned trips,
  processing trips, forecast/current/FCR, send-to-trip source display, Comments,
  and Activity.
- Keep pig batch workflow split across `PigBatchPage`, `PigBatchHubTile`,
  `usePigMortality`, `usePigSubBatches`, `usePigPlannedTrips`, and
  `usePigProcessingTrips`.
- `PigContext.feedersLoaded` is the readiness boundary.
- Farm-born feeder batches are created from farrowing cycles, not manually from
  `/pig/batches`.
- Planned-trip row shape stays `{id, date, sex, subBatchId, plannedCount,
  order}`.
- Planned-trip locks live only in `ppp-pig-planned-trip-locks-v1`.
- Planned-trip forecast weights are render-only and based on DOB/farrowing age
  at trip date times Global ADG.
- Pig Batches hub rows use the locked 14-column inspection grid and open the
  batch record page.
- Breeding pigs (`/pig/sows`) are grouped table sections. The row is the record
  navigation target. Do not reintroduce the old PigTile/Record-button/modal-only
  workflow.
- Breeding-pig record pages use `pig.breeder` and mount Comments + Activity.
- Pig weigh-in record pages render entries in a dense table, not cards/badges.
  The leftmost column is the send-to-trip checkbox for eligible draft rows;
  sent/transferred rows are locked in-row. Weight/note autosave, prior weight,
  days, delta, ADG, undo send, transfer to breeding, undo transfer, and delete
  remain preserved.
- `/pig/weighins` is a navigation list split into Active and Complete sections.
  Pig list saved views, CSV export, Print, and status filters are intentionally
  removed. Broiler weigh-in lists keep the shared saved-view/export/print/filter
  behavior.

### Broiler, Layers, And Feed Planning

- Broiler batches live in `ppp-v4`.
- Login-gated `/weighins` cannot read or mutate `app_store.ppp-v4` directly.
- Week 4/6 completion uses `stamp_broiler_batch_avg` RPC.
- Broiler batch record Week 4 and Week 6 weight fields are read-only display
  values sourced from completed weigh-ins.
- Layer `current_count` is the physical anchor; projected count subtracts
  mortalities since anchor.
- Feed math lives in `src/lib/feedPlanner.js` and `src/lib/feedOrderBasis.js`.
- Feed-order recommendations use the latest active-month physical count when
  present; otherwise they fall back to previous-month estimate.
- Poultry feed-order math is per feed type: starter, grower, layerfeed.
- "Count includes `<month>` order" prevents double-counting the delivery.
- The feed-order board is calendar-pinned. Pig and broiler both show the next
  calendar month order card until the calendar advances; saving the order does
  not advance the visible board to the following month.
- The second feed summary tile for pig and broiler stays pinned to the current
  calendar month estimate via `estTileYM`.
- Broiler on-farm counts are centralized in `computeBroilerOnFarmCounts`.
- Broiler batch status auto-advances in `loadAllData`: planned -> active on/after
  hatch date, active -> processed on/after processing date.

### Tasks

- `/tasks` is canonical. `/my-tasks` and `/admin/tasks` are aliases only.
- Task writes go through v2 wrappers/RPCs.
- Frontend must not call `generate_system_task_instance`; `tasks-cron` is the
  runtime caller for system-task generation.
- System task rules live in `task_system_rules`; assignee and active state stay
  data-driven there, and the cron uses `lead_time_days` as the minting horizon.
- `task_instance_photos` is canonical. Legacy single-photo columns are display
  fallback only.
- Task photos are capped at 5 total per task across creation and completion;
  migration `114` is the DB backstop.
- To Do List lives inside Task Center at `/tasks/todo` and `/tasks/todo/<id>`.
- To Do participants are `light`, `farm_team`, `management`, and `admin`;
  `equipment_tech` and inactive are excluded.
- Non-manager To Do completion submissions enter `pending_approval` and notify
  management/admin; approval or auto-approval notifies the To Do creator.

### Equipment

- Logged-in equipment lives under `/fleet`.
- Login-gated equipment checklist/fueling lives under `/equipment`.
- Equipment fueling submissions use `submit_equipment_fueling` RPC.
- Light My Submissions edits/deletes its own equipment fuelings and fuel
  supplies through ownership RPCs.
- Fuel-log edit/delete paths recompute current readings from remaining fuel logs.
- Equipment checklist/material edits must not reload, lose focus, or reorder list
  items on click/edit.
- Admin client error review is at `/admin/client-errors` and reads through
  `list_client_errors` only.

### Login-Gated Webforms And Offline Queue

- Login-gated webforms must not read `app_store` directly or use browser
  secrets.
- Former public forms now use Supabase auth state intentionally for login and
  locked submitter identity.
- Light is allowed only on contained report/form surfaces; weigh-ins, Production,
  and Pasture Map remain outside the Light allowlist.
- Offline queue IndexedDB ownership is centralized in `src/lib/offlineQueue.js`.
- Offline RPC replay goes through `useOfflineRpcSubmit` where needed.
- Ownership stamping is server-side on replay.
- Shared TEST DB Playwright specs that reset/seed the DB must run one file at a
  time.

### Storage And File Inputs

- Upload owner/count guards are intentionally brittle.
- New upload/remove/signed/public URL owners require updating the matching static
  guard.
- Task, daily, and comment attachment uploads are append-only.
- Image file inputs intentionally omit `capture=` so mobile users can choose
  camera or library upload through the native picker.

### Runtime Observability

- `client_error_events` records redacted browser/runtime errors through
  `record_client_error`.
- `/admin/client-errors` is read-only, admin-gated, fail-closed, paginated, and
  uses `list_client_errors`.
- Client error reporting must not store raw localStorage, auth tokens, full
  payloads, or secret-like data.

### Shared UI And Record Chrome

- Global openable affordance is shared through `.hoverable-tile` for card/div
  openables and `.hoverable-row` for table-row openables.
- Do not put `.hoverable-tile` on `<tr>` or `.hoverable-row` on non-`tr`
  elements.
- `RecordPageShell` owns record-page frame/loading/not-found/body/title chrome.
- `RecordCollaborationSection` is the only component that composes
  `CommentsSection` and `RecordActivityLog`.
- `RecordActivityLog` is audit-only and filters `comment.posted`.
- `RecordSequenceNav` is the shared sequence-navigation primitive.
- `DataTable` owns table/list rendering for comparable records: real `<table>`,
  sticky header, `.hoverable-row` row-open, fail-closed load/error/empty states,
  optional row selection, Active/Complete `SectionBand`s, and mobile stacked
  record-lines.
- `Badge` is for true lifecycle/status labels only. Use `StatusText` for inline
  soft signals and supporting status ink.
- Program/species accents come from `src/lib/programColors.js` and should appear
  as dots, selected pills, or rare headline accents, not as status badges or
  broad surface themes.
- `Toolbar` owns page action bars; `Tabs` owns in-page tab strips. Header
  section navigation remains owned by `Header.jsx`.
- `app_saved_views` saved views are a generic per-surface primitive.
- `DeleteModal` and `ConfirmModal` are app-level modal primitives.
- CSV export ownership lives in `csvExport.js`; row-print export ownership lives
  in `printExport.js`.
- Record page controls live in `src/shared/recordPageControls.jsx`.

### Source Boundary Guards

Static guards lock these boundaries. If a legitimate new owner is added, update
the guard in the same lane and explain why:

- Supabase client owner.
- Browser secret/env usage.
- `app_store`, `webform_config`, `profiles` access.
- `localStorage` owner/key inventory.
- IndexedDB/offline queue owner.
- Notifications client-write prohibition.
- Task API boundary.
- Comments/Activity table access.
- Route alias ownership.
- Light portal/access boundary.
- Login-gated webforms boundary.
- Storage upload/remove/signed/public URL ownership.
- Append-only bucket upload contracts.
- Image file input capture contract.
- Hard-delete owner inventory.
- Mutation semantics inventory.
- CP2 daily writes via ownership RPCs.
- Delete/recovery classification.
- Legacy Activity retirement.
- Load/retry readiness inventory.
- Design token and radius-floor contracts.
- Shared UI extraction contract.
- Openable hover affordance contract.

Playwright notes:

- Specs that reset the shared TEST DB must run one file at a time.
- Local dev-server cold-start can hang if stray node/vite processes remain in
  old worktrees. Clear stale processes before diagnosing product flake.

## Agent Session Checklist

Before a new lane:

1. Read [HO.md](HO.md).
2. Read Current State, Build Queue, and the relevant contracts here.
3. Run `git status --short`, `git worktree list`, and inspect recent `git log`.
4. Identify dirty-tree risk, active worktrees, open gates, and migration state.
5. Inspect files in scope before planning.
6. If touching a boundary guard, update the guard in the same lane.
7. If touching SQL/RPC/RLS/Storage, state TEST/PROD apply and verification needs
   in the plan.
8. If approving a commit gate, queue the next CC-ready prompt in the same Codex
   response per [HO.md](HO.md).

## Archives

- Older narrative history: `archive/SESSION_LOG.md`.
- Research, screenshots, audits, and video evaluations:
  `C:\Users\Ronni\cc-research\`.
- Parity audit evidence:
  `C:\Users\Ronni\cc-research\parity-audit-2026-06-05-CC.md`.
- Detailed build history lives in git log and tests. Keep this file as the
  compact project map, not a running transcript.
