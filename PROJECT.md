## Current State

- Production: `https://wcfplanner.com`
- Deploy: Netlify auto-deploy from `main`
- Production source: `origin/main` via Netlify auto-deploy.
- Latest confirmed shipped checkpoint: `4b541e7 fix(cattle):
  mobile-legible cattle batch weights + read-only complete editing`.
- Open gates: none. Current source is clean on `main` / `origin/main`.
  Cattle processing batch record pages are live at `/cattle/batches/<id>`
  for scheduled/active/complete rows. `/cattle/batches` is navigation-only
  for real batches; virtual planned batches remain list-only. Complete
  cattle processing batches show mobile-legible live/hanging weights and are
  read-only until reopened.
  Comment-photos Storage RLS hotfix is live (migration 073). Broiler
  record page and weigh-in hardening shipped in prior checkpoints.
  Remaining batch/processing record pages (sheep, pig, broiler, layer)
  are deferred until identity/workflow design is complete.
- PROD migrations live: `057` notifications, `058` activity events,
  `060` mention contract, `062` activity entity expansion, `063`
  notification activity resolution, `064` activity Phase 2 entities, `065`
  global activity log, `066` activity change events, `067` daily soft-delete,
  `068` client error events / durable client error reporting, `069` cattle
  animal soft-delete / restore, `070` daily delete for active roles, `071`
  comments foundation, `072` weigh-in session Activity entity, `073`
  comment-photos Storage RLS.
- PROD migrations drafted/stashed only: `059_daily_unique_indexes.sql` is not
  applied. `061_daily_report_soft_delete_restore.sql` is superseded by `067`.
- CI note: verify may be red from known unrelated Playwright flakes. Do not mix
  CI-stabilization work into feature lanes.

### Shipped Checkpoint: Phase 1 Cattle Record Page + Comments Foundation

Status: live on PROD. Cattle record pages, Comments foundation, PROD migration
`071`, and the private `comment-photos` Storage bucket are shipped. Follow-up
UI hotfixes for the record title/header, cow-to-cow navigation, breeding
blacklist control, and herds-page Recently Deleted removal are also shipped.

Migration `071_comments_foundation.sql` is applied to TEST and PROD. The
`comment-photos` private Storage bucket exists on TEST and PROD.

What was built:
- Dedicated cattle animal record page at `/cattle/herds/<id>`.
- CattleHerdsView refactored as hub with CattleHerdsRouter wrapper:
  tiles navigate to record page, inline CowDetail expansion removed,
  Activity chips/modal removed, cowNavStack/cattle_comments removed,
  CollapsibleOutcomeSections updated.
- Reusable Comments layer: `comments` + `comment_edits` tables, 7 SECDEF
  RPCs (list/count/post/edit/delete comments + edit history +
  mentionable profiles), `comment_mention` notification type with direct
  entity routing columns on notifications, `list_recent_notifications`
  updated.
- CommentsSection component with @mentions (via dedicated RPC, not task
  assignees), photo/document attachments (compress + upload + signed
  URLs), inline edit with attachment add/remove, edit history display
  with previous attachments, soft-delete with non-admin redaction + admin
  audit, newest-first ordering.
- CattleAnimalPage: CowDetail fields (hideComments=true suppresses
  legacy section), CommentsSection, collapsed audit-only Activity log
  (filters out comment.posted), back navigation, hash anchor scroll for
  comment deep-links.
- comment_mention notification routing: resolveNotificationRoute handles
  comment_mention with #comment-<id> hash, Header navigates directly to
  record page URL.
- activityRegistry cattle.animal route returns /cattle/herds/<id>,
  routeToView handles cattle sub-paths.
- Static tests: cattle_record_page_static.test.js (55 tests),
  comments_foundation_static.test.js (65 tests).

Files created:
- supabase-migrations/071_comments_foundation.sql
- src/cattle/CattleAnimalPage.jsx
- src/shared/CommentsSection.jsx
- src/lib/commentsApi.js
- src/lib/commentAttachments.js
- tests/static/cattle_record_page_static.test.js
- tests/static/comments_foundation_static.test.js

Files modified:
- src/main.jsx (URL adapter for cattle herds sub-paths)
- src/cattle/CattleHerdsView.jsx (hub routing, removed inline expansion)
- src/cattle/CollapsibleOutcomeSections.jsx (onCowClick instead of
  renderCowDetail)
- src/cattle/CowDetail.jsx (hideComments prop, Issues label rename)
- src/lib/activityRegistry.js (cattle route, comment_mention routing,
  routeToView)
- src/shared/Header.jsx (comment_mention direct navigation)
- src/shared/MentionTextarea.jsx (loadProfiles prop)
- tests/static/global_activity_tile_wiring_static.test.js
- tests/static/mention_deep_links_static.test.js
- tests/static/animal_detail_age.test.js
- PROJECT.md (Codex doc updates)

E2E proof results (all passed on TEST):
- farm_team posted/listed comment
- Mention picker returns active profiles only, no role exposed
- @mention creates comment_mention notification with entity routing
- Self-mention rejected
- Edit preserves history
- Admin cannot edit others, can delete others
- Non-admin sees redacted deleted body (NULL), admin sees full body
- Activity log has zero comment.posted events for test comments
- User deletes own comment

Post-ship cleanup completed:
- Cattle record page shows the app header and a large `#tag` page title.
- Cow-to-cow links remount the record detail and keep back navigation scoped to
  actual cow-to-cow navigation.
- Breeding blacklist renders as a compact red pill; the checkbox explicitly
  overrides the global input width.
- Herds page no longer shows a Recently Deleted box. Cattle restore backend
  support remains available, but that recovery surface is not part of the herds
  page.

Follow-on status:
1. `equipment.item`, `task.instance`, all six daily report types, and
   `weighin.session` for all species have since migrated to the operational
   record-page pattern.
2. Broiler weigh-in session support, list cleanup, and focused workflow
   hardening are all shipped.

### Shipped Checkpoint: Phase 2A/2B Record Page Rollout

Status: live on PROD. Sheep animal record pages and all six authenticated daily
report record pages are shipped.

What was built:
- Dedicated sheep animal record pages at `/sheep/flocks/<id>` with app header,
  `#tag` title, SheepDetail, CommentsSection, collapsed Activity log,
  sheep-to-sheep navigation state, and retired inline expansion.
- Dedicated record pages for `poultry.daily`, `layer.daily`, `egg.daily`,
  `pig.daily`, `cattle.daily`, and `sheep.daily`, each with Comments and
  collapsed Activity history.
- Legacy Activity chips/modal surfaces retired from cattle, sheep, and all six
  daily report views. Lists now route to the durable record pages instead of
  hosting primary per-record workspaces.

Follow-up shipped after the rollout:
- Inline editing is live on all six daily record pages. Record pages open
  directly editable; no separate edit-mode button/toggle is the site standard.

Deferred from the rollout:
- Processing/batch record pages. These require identity and workflow design
  before migration.

### Shipped Checkpoint: Equipment, Task, Daily Edit, And Weigh-In Sessions

Status: live on PROD through `2924d3f`. Equipment, task, daily edit, and
all-species weigh-in session record-page work is shipped.

What was built:
- `equipment.item` record pages live at `/fleet/<id>`. Fleet tiles are
  summary/open-record surfaces only; record pages own Comments and collapsed
  Activity history. Activity routes use durable equipment IDs.
- `task.instance` record pages live at `/tasks/<id>`. Task list rows navigate
  to records, legacy `?task=<id>` redirects, and notifications use direct
  record-page routing through the explicit Header allowlist.
- `RecordActivityLog` is the shared collapsed audit-log component across
  migrated animal, daily, equipment, task, and weigh-in record pages.
- All six daily record pages are immediately editable and log saved changes via
  Activity where wired. Add Feed webform rows hide operational-only fields.
- Migration `072_weighin_session_activity_entity.sql` is applied to PROD.
  `weighin.session` is registered in Activity, the global Activity log, Header
  direct-route allowlist, and notification/deep-link routing.
- `/weigh-in-sessions/<id>` is live for cattle, sheep, pig, and broiler
  sessions. All four list views are navigation-only surfaces. Pig send-to-trip
  and transfer-to-breeding workflows live on the record page. Broiler metadata
  editing (week 4/6, team member), schooner weight grid, session notes, and
  ppp-v4 side effects (complete/reopen/delete/week-change) live on the record
  page. `LivestockWeighInsView` broiler inline workspace removed.
- Focused Playwright hardening shipped: list-to-record navigation (all 4
  species), save/reload persistence (cattle/sheep/pig), Comments hash scroll,
  cattle/sheep Send-to-Processor from record page, pig Send-to-Trip from
  record page, broiler metadata/grid/reopen E2E.

### Recent Shipped Work

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Eggmobile 3 fallback | Live. Layer housing count fallback restored Eggmobile 3 and active layer totals. |
| Daily duplicate prevention | Live. Pre-submit duplicate guards are merged; DB unique-index migration `059` remains unapplied. |
| Broiler batch location labels | Live. Broiler daily/report dropdowns show current housing/location labels while storing the plain batch name. |
| Home Weather | Live. Tomorrow.io forecast proxy, 10-day forecast, rain/freeze focus, and animated radar are on Home. |
| Notifications Center | Live. `task_completed` and `mention` notifications use `public.notifications`; task and non-task mention deep-links are live. |
| Activity + @Mentions | Mixed. Comments, @mentions, and deep-links are live through operational record pages where migrated. Legacy compact Activity chips/modal remain only on unmigrated surfaces and must not be expanded as the long-term pattern. |
| Global Activity Log | Live at `/activity`. Permission-filtered RPC reads `activity_events`; legacy comments, task completions, deleted-comment placeholders, and explicit system/change events show there today. New Comments foundation should keep comment text out of the global audit feed except for approved notification/deep-link metadata. |
| Activity Layer foundation | Live. `record_activity_event` records allowlisted change/lifecycle events through SECDEF RPC. Layer batch notes and equipment status are pilot surfaces. |
| Entity mutation helper | Live. `runMutation` standardizes client mutation errors plus optional best-effort Activity logging; it is not transactional. |
| Daily soft-delete + restore | Live. Transactional SECDEF RPCs `soft_delete_daily_report` / `restore_daily_report`. Soft-delete is allowed for any active authenticated role; restore remains admin-only. 6 daily entity types registered. `deleted_at`/`deleted_by` on all 6 daily tables. All read sites filtered. Admin Recently Deleted tab with restore. `record.deleted`/`record.restored` Activity events with human-readable labels. |
| Cattle soft-delete + restore | Live. Admin-only source-row soft-delete/restore for `cattle.animal` through SECDEF RPCs in migration `069`. Normal cattle reads hide deleted rows; no cattle DELETE policy remains. The herds-page Recently Deleted box was removed; restore remains a backend/admin capability for a future proper recovery surface. |
| Daily per-record Activity UI | Retired from all 6 authenticated daily views. Daily report record pages now own immediately editable fields, Comments, and collapsed Activity history. |
| Home missed pig breeding-stock dailys | Live. Home missed-report checks include active SOWS and BOARS breeding-stock groups in addition to pig feeder groups. |
| Operational Record Pages foundation | Live on `cattle.animal`, `sheep.animal`, all 6 daily report entity types, `equipment.item`, `task.instance`, `weighin.session` for all 4 species, and `cattle.processing` at `/cattle/batches/<id>`. Site-wide standard is dedicated pages for operational records. Tiles/lists are clean summaries only. Record pages own fields, editing, Comments, attachments, Activity log, edit history, and future related tools. Remaining batch/processing pages (sheep, pig, broiler, layer) deferred for identity/workflow design. |
| Cattle processing batch record pages | Live at `/cattle/batches/<id>` for scheduled/active/complete rows. Virtual planned batches remain list-only. CommentsSection + RecordActivityLog. Complete batch weights are mobile-legible and read-only until reopened; active records use blur-save name editing with no Save Name button. Unschedule Activity deferred pending soft-delete strategy. ActivityPanel/ActivityModal retired from the list view. |
| Comment-photos Storage RLS | Live. Migration 073 adds authenticated INSERT + SELECT policies on `storage.objects` for the `comment-photos` bucket. Fixes "new row violates row-level security policy" on comment photo attachments. |
| Animal transfer handler hardening | Live. Cattle/sheep animal transfer handlers now check primary animal update errors before writing transfer audit rows, surface warning notices when audit insert fails after a successful move, and no-op when destination matches the current herd/flock. |
| Weigh-in session record pages | Live for cattle, sheep, pig, and broiler at `/weigh-in-sessions/<id>`. All 4 list views are navigation-only. Pig send-to-trip and transfer-to-breeding, broiler metadata/grid/ppp-v4 side effects all live on the record page. Focused Playwright hardening shipped for all species. |
| Codebase hardening and cleanup | Planned. Cleanup is a first-class roadmap track: retire deprecated UI/data paths as entities migrate, remove dead code with proof, extract shared record-page/list patterns, and document what remains intentionally legacy. |
| Error Resilience Phase 1 | Live. App-root ErrorBoundary, global `error` and `unhandledrejection` capture, and durable redacted client error events through `record_client_error` SECDEF RPC / `client_error_events` table. |
| Activity change logging | Live. Routine saved edits on migrated record pages record `field.updated`/`status.changed`/lifecycle Activity events where wired, including `cattle.animal`, `sheep.animal`, `equipment.item`, daily records, task instances, and cattle/sheep/pig weigh-in sessions. Cattle delete/restore is transactional/audited; sheep delete/restore, lifecycle/move actions, equipment child records, and admin-only documents remain deferred. |
| Stash hygiene | Complete. Three superseded WIP stashes were audited and dropped; `git stash list` verified empty and `main` matched `origin/main`. |
| Hamburger cleanup | Live. Hamburger has Home, Activity, Webforms: Dailys/Equipment, Admin/Users, Sign Out. |
| Home farrow window wording | Live. Misleading `N pending` text removed from Home Next 30 Days farrowing windows. |
| Tasks v2 | Canonical at `/tasks`; old `/my-tasks` and `/admin/tasks` are aliases. |

### Parked WIP Stash

Stash numbers can change if new stashes are added; always verify with
`git stash list` before acting. Do not pop or drop blindly.

No parked WIP stashes are expected as of 2026-05-26. The prior three
superseded stashes were audited and dropped during stash hygiene.

## Active Roadmap

1. Codebase hardening and cleanup - remove deprecated patterns as each entity
   migrates, classify legacy/import/test-only code, and reduce context burn for
   future sessions.
2. Record Page migration plan - migrate remaining operational entities to the
   same dedicated record-page pattern in phases; no new Activity bubbles,
   inline record workspaces, or modal-based record workspaces.
3. Sheep delete/restore strategy design - decide source-row soft-delete vs
   tombstone/resolver model before implementation.
4. Audit-grade SECDEF RPCs - cattle/sheep lifecycle/status/move actions where
   mutation + Activity must be atomic.
5. Custom editable-table Activity - after record pages exist, add scoped
   history for operational tables such as cattle forecast month hide/unhide,
   feed forecast edits, breeding schedule edits, and similar table workflows.
6. Critical workflow Playwright matrix - define coverage targets, write specs
   for highest-risk uncovered paths.
7. Incremental mutation cleanup - domain by domain per Identity Map. Choose
   direct / `runMutation` / SECDEF per entity risk.
8. Shared UI extraction - extract filter bar, summary row, loading/empty/error
   patterns from views that repeat them 3+ times.
9. Deferred: code-splitting - only when field-device measurements or
   operator pain justify it.
10. Deferred: TypeScript - gradual `allowJs` + JSDoc approach if/when
   started.

## Platform Roadmap

Longer-term direction organized by capability tier. Active Roadmap items
above are the near-term build queue drawn from these tiers.

### Operational Record Pages And Collaboration

Operational records use dedicated record pages as the site-wide standard.
Tiles and list rows are clean summaries only: no comment composer, no inline
comment thread, no Activity bubble, and no inline expanded record workspace.
Summary surfaces may show lightweight counts or indicators, but opening a
record navigates to that record's unique URL.

The record page is the operational workspace. It owns record fields, on-page
editing, Comments, comment attachments, comment edit history, collapsed Activity
log, related record sections, and future record-specific tools. Browser
history, refresh, bookmarks, shared links, and notification deep-links should
all target this page.

Modals are allowed for narrow confirmations and small helper flows such as
delete confirmation or quick creation. Modals are not the primary workspace for
operational records, Comments, Activity, attachments, or edit history. Inline
expansion is not the primary workspace for operational records.

This foundation applies to operational farm records, including Tasks. It does
not apply to admin/config/setup records unless a later lane explicitly promotes
one to an operational record.

### Comments Foundation

Comments are user discussion. Activity is system/audit history. They are
separate layers even when they sit near each other on a record page.

Comments are keyed by `entity_type` + `entity_id`, so the thread belongs to the
underlying record and follows that record everywhere it appears. Comments are
not stored as `activity_events`, and posting/editing/deleting a comment must
not create routine Activity log noise. Mention notifications may be created by
comment actions, but the Activity log remains audit/system-event only.

The Comments layer supports plain text, line breaks, clickable pasted URLs,
active-user @mentions, photo/document attachments, author edit/delete,
admin delete-any, soft-delete placeholders, and visible edit history. The
normal user surface shows deleted comments as `Comment deleted`; admins can
view deleted contents/history for audit.

Canonical planned storage:

- `comments`: one row per user comment, keyed by `entity_type` + `entity_id`,
  with author profile, body, mentions, attachment metadata, edited/deleted
  metadata, and created timestamp.
- `comment_edits`: immutable edit-history rows storing the prior body, prior
  attachment state, editor, and timestamp.
- Comment attachment metadata is stored with the comment/edit record and points
  at private Storage objects. If attachments outgrow JSONB metadata, add a
  dedicated attachment table in a later migration.

If implementation chooses different table names, update this section in the
same commit so the contract stays exact.

In-record narrative fields are named `Issues`. The word `Comments` is reserved
for the discussion layer. Existing labels such as notes, comments/concerns,
operator comments, or session comments should be standardized to `Issues` as
their owning record pages are migrated. Do not perform broad schema renames
without a separate migration plan.

### Completed Phase 1 Cattle Record Page Scope

Phase 1 proved the foundation on `cattle.animal` and is live on PROD.

Required outcomes:

- Add a stable cattle animal record page route.
- Make cattle tiles/list rows open that record page.
- Remove cattle inline expansion as a primary experience.
- Remove the cattle animal edit modal as the primary edit experience.
- Cattle create modal may remain as a narrow create helper unless a later lane
  moves create flows onto record pages too.
- Move cattle animal fields and existing related cattle sections into the
  record-page workspace.
- Preserve existing cattle save semantics, including debounced/autosaved field
  changes and save-on-close/navigation where applicable.
- Add the reusable Comments layer with mentions, attachments, edit/delete,
  edit history, and soft-delete placeholders.
- Show Activity as a collapsed audit/system log, not as a bubble.
- Keep comment actions out of the Activity log.
- Wire mention notifications to the cattle record page and target comment.
- Rename visible cattle record narrative/comment-style fields to `Issues`
  where this phase touches them.
- Remove or update stale cattle tests that only prove the retired inline/modal
  behavior, replacing them with record-page tests.

Still out of scope after Phase 1:

- Migrating other entities; that is now the next active phase.
- Broad schema renames for existing in-record notes/comments fields.
- Reactions/emoji, real-time updates, or admin/config record pages.
- Production migration/deploy actions without Ronnie's separate gates.

### Codebase Hardening And Cleanup

Cleanup is a first-class roadmap track. The goal is a codebase that future
Codex/CC sessions can understand quickly without repeatedly loading obsolete
patterns, dead UI paths, or import-only data.

Cleanup rules:

- Remove deprecated code in the same entity phase that replaces it. When an
  entity moves to record pages, retire its Activity bubble, inline workspace,
  record-workspace modal, old deep-link path, and obsolete tests in that lane.
- Do not delete code by vibes. Removal needs proof: `rg`/import search,
  route/registry checks, focused tests, and a clear explanation of what
  replaced it.
- Keep compatibility code only when a live data shape, printed/public URL, or
  migration path still needs it. Mark it as legacy in `PROJECT.md` or a nearby
  comment with the condition for removal.
- Prefer deleting obsolete surfaces over hiding them behind flags once the new
  surface is validated.
- Avoid cleanup-only mega-PRs. Bundle cleanup with the domain migration that
  proves the replacement, or run small mechanical cleanup lanes with explicit
  test coverage.
- Keep source files focused. Large views should shrink as shared record-page,
  summary-list, filter-bar, and mutation primitives are extracted from proven
  repeated patterns.
- Large import artifacts, archived migrations, and test fixtures are not
  runtime app code. Do not load or reason through them in normal feature lanes
  unless the lane touches import/history/test bootstrap behavior.

Hardening sequence:

1. Record-page migration: each operational entity gets one page route, one
   summary surface, one Comments layer, and one Activity audit section.
2. Legacy UI retirement: remove Activity bubbles, ActivityModal usage, inline
   expanded record workspaces, and record-workspace edit modals for migrated
   entities.
3. Comments separation: move user discussion off legacy `activity_events`
   comment RPCs for migrated entities; keep Activity as audit/system history.
4. Mutation semantics: classify writes per entity as direct, `runMutation`, or
   SECDEF RPC. Move audit-critical flows to atomic server paths.
5. Delete/recovery: convert unsafe hard deletes to source-row soft-delete or a
   tombstone/resolver design, with restore expectations documented.
6. Identity cleanup: give `app_store` operational records stable IDs before
   adding record pages, Comments, Activity, or audit trails.
7. Shared UI extraction: extract only patterns proven across 3+ migrated
   surfaces.
8. Test matrix: each migrated entity gets static contract tests and at least
   one focused Playwright workflow covering open, edit, comment, mention, and
   Activity visibility.
9. Context hygiene: update `PROJECT.md` in each phase so future sessions know
   what is live, what is legacy, what can be ignored, and what is scheduled for
   removal.

Target cleanup outcomes:

- No Activity bubbles remain on migrated operational entities.
- No operational record's primary workspace is an inline expansion or modal.
- No new user discussion is stored in `activity_events`.
- No stale deep-link path opens a removed modal or inline panel.
- No broad feature lane needs to inspect import dumps, archived migrations, or
  unrelated legacy compatibility code.
- The Record Identity Map remains the starting point for every entity lane.

### Record Identity and Audit Coverage

Every meaningful entity needs a stable ID, human label, route/deep-link,
permission resolver, Activity/comments status, mutation path, and audit
status. The Record Identity Map below is the planning anchor. Expand it as
new entities gain Activity, mutation helpers, or delete/restore support.

### Error Resilience and Runtime Signals

Phase 1 shipped. App-root ErrorBoundary catches render/lifecycle crashes.
Global `error` and `unhandledrejection` listeners capture async/event
failures. Redacted client error events persist durably through
`record_client_error` SECDEF RPC and `client_error_events` table (migration
068). Feature-level error handling also remains (Header badges soft-fail,
RPC callers catch, offline queue classifies errors). Admin dashboard,
alerting, trend views, and external monitoring services are later tiers.

### Mutation Semantics

~200 direct `sb.from()` mutation calls exist across `src/`. Direct calls are
not automatically wrong - the missing piece is per-entity write semantics.
`runMutation` fits routine saves that want optional Activity logging. SECDEF
RPCs fit audit-critical flows where mutation and Activity must succeed or
fail together. `runMutation` caller count is not a success metric; correct
write path per entity is.

### Delete/Restore and Recovery Strategy

Daily reports and `cattle.animal` prove source-row soft-delete without
tombstones: the source row remains with `deleted_at`, and the Activity resolver
sees deleted rows. Remaining domains need deliberate design: sheep hard-delete
orphans children, and equipment/task sub-records still need per-entity recovery
decisions. Tombstones are only needed where source rows cannot remain
resolver-visible after deletion.

### Test Coverage Matrix

Test coverage is broad and changes frequently; avoid treating exact file/test
counts as durable project truth. Coverage is weighted toward tasks, activity,
and cattle soft-delete. Broader cattle CRUD, equipment lifecycle, and weigh-in
flows have thinner E2E coverage. The matrix should define which workflows must
always have Playwright coverage and fill gaps incrementally.

### Shared UI Extraction

14 shared components exist in `src/shared/`. The path is extraction from
proven patterns, not top-down design. When a pattern repeats across 3+
views (filter bar, date-grouped summary list, status indicator row,
loading/empty/error states), extract it.

### Deferred Long-Term Maturity

- TypeScript: 105k lines of pure JS. Gradual `allowJs` + JSDoc + typed
  utility modules when started, not a repo-wide conversion.
- Code-splitting: current 2 MB main chunk loads once and is browser-cached.
  Dynamic `import()` already defers xlsx and pdfjs-dist. Route-level
  splitting is justified only when field-device measurements show a problem.

---

## Record Identity Map

Compact reference for per-entity platform decisions. Default permission model
is RLS for table-backed entities and `program_access` checks for `app_store`
entities. Each operational entity needs a stable ID, route, record page,
permission resolver, mutation path, delete/recovery behavior, Comments, and
Activity logging. Expand this table as entities migrate to the operational
record-page foundation.

### app_store JSON - No Stable Per-Record ID

| Key | Domain | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ppp-v4` | broiler batches | `batch.name` is display ID; no UUID per record |
| `ppp-feeders-v1` | pig feeder groups + sub-batches | group-level ID exists; sub-batch IDs are client-generated |
| `ppp-pigs-v1` | pig herd data | no per-record stable ID |
| `ppp-breeding-v1` | pig breeding cycles | no per-record stable ID |
| `ppp-farrowing-v1` | pig farrowing records | no per-record stable ID |
| `ppp-breeders-v1` | pig breeders | no per-record stable ID |
| `ppp-feed-orders-v1` | feed orders | no per-record stable ID |
| `ppp-pig-feed-inventory-v1` | pig feed inventory | no per-record stable ID |
| `ppp-poultry-feed-inventory-v1` | poultry feed inventory | no per-record stable ID |

Entities without stable per-record IDs cannot participate in Activity,
deep-links, or per-record audit trails until identity decisions are made.

### Operational Record Page Migration Plan

Phase 1 (`cattle.animal`), Phase 2A (`sheep.animal`), Phase 2B (all six
daily report entity types), equipment/task, and `weighin.session` for
cattle/sheep/pig are live. They replaced inline/list-page primary record
workspaces with dedicated record pages and reusable Comments/Activity
foundation.

Operational entity types with record pages:
`cattle.animal`, `sheep.animal`, all 6 daily report entity types,
`equipment.item`, `task.instance`, `weighin.session` for all 4 species,
and `cattle.processing` at `/cattle/batches/<id>`.

Planned rollout order:

1. Completed: `cattle.animal`, `sheep.animal`, `poultry.daily`,
   `layer.daily`, `egg.daily`, `pig.daily`, `cattle.daily`, `sheep.daily`,
   `equipment.item`, `task.instance`, `weighin.session` for all species,
   and `cattle.processing`.
2. Shared record-page shell / contracts - extract only what is proven from
   shipped record pages: header/back/title/loading/not-found conventions,
   Comments placement, collapsed Activity audit log placement, and
   route/deep-link expectations. Keep extraction thin; do not block entity
   migration on a large design-system rewrite.
3. Remaining batch and processing records - `broiler.batch`, `pig.batch`,
   `layer.batch`, `layer.housing`, and `sheep.processing`; defer until each
   entity has durable identity and a workflow-specific record-page design.
   Virtual planned batches and app-store records must not be forced into the
   animal/daily pattern prematurely.
4. Custom editable-table Activity - after record pages exist, add table-scoped
   audit/history for forecast/feed/breeding workflows. First target should be
   cattle forecast month hide/unhide.

Each phase must retire legacy Activity bubbles, record-workspace modals, and
inline expanded record workspaces for the entity it migrates. Do not leave
parallel primary experiences in place.

---

## Known Platform Risks

These are hardening priorities, not reasons to rewrite.

- Hard-delete data loss and audit blindness. Daily reports and `cattle.animal`
  now use soft-delete/restore with Activity events. Routine saved edits on
  migrated record pages log Activity events where wired, including
  cattle/sheep/pig weigh-in sessions. Sheep delete/restore, livestock
  lifecycle/move actions, equipment sub-records, broiler weigh-in sessions,
  breeding/lambing records, and task templates still need recovery and audit
  decisions. Sheep hard-delete orphans children. Cattle processing batch
  unschedule is hard-delete with no Activity event (deferred pending
  soft-delete strategy). See the Record Identity Map for per-entity delete
  behavior.
- Direct client mutations are the dominant write pattern (~200 call sites in
  `src`). Direct calls are not automatically wrong; the missing piece is
  per-entity write semantics specifying which paths should be direct,
  `runMutation`, or SECDEF RPC. Cattle/sheep animal transfers now check
  primary update failures before audit writes, but remain client-side and
  non-atomic. The Record Identity Map tracks this.
- Runtime observability is Phase 1 only. Redacted client error events now
  persist through migration 068, but there is no admin UI, alerting, trend
  view, or third-party monitoring. Keep future logging changes redacted and
  minimal.
- `runMutation` is non-transactional. If a client mutation succeeds and its
  Activity RPC fails, the data change is already committed. Audit-critical
  paths need transactional SECDEF RPCs/triggers.
- `app_store` JSON entities need stable per-record IDs before they can
  participate in Activity, deep-links, and per-record audit trails.
- Legacy Activity comments currently live inside `activity_events` and are
  displayed through compact chips / ActivityModal on migrated surfaces. The new
  foundation separates Comments from Activity and retires those UI patterns
  entity by entity.
- Deprecated UI paths and compatibility code will accumulate unless each
  record-page migration removes the old path it replaces. Cleanup is part of
  each migration lane, not optional polish.
- Playwright coverage is weighted toward tasks, activity, and cattle
  soft-delete. Broader cattle CRUD, equipment lifecycle, and weigh-in flows
  have thinner E2E coverage.
- `059_daily_unique_indexes.sql` remains unapplied. Do not apply until
  duplicate cleanup is explicitly approved and a safe `egg_dailys` scope is
  designed.
- Current main JS chunk is ~2 MB. Dynamic `import()` already defers xlsx
  and pdfjs-dist. Route-level code-splitting is deferred unless
  field-device measurements or operator pain justify it.

---

## Locked Decisions

- No Home Dashboard duplicate-report card.
- No routine duplicate-report notification fanout.
- Future duplicate handling should prevent the duplicate before save where
  possible, then use DB constraints where the scope is valid.
- `egg_dailys` gets warning/pre-submit guard only. Its current data does not
  support a safe hard unique scope.
- Deleted records need global visibility because the original summary tile may
  no longer exist. Per-record page history is not enough for recovery.
- Operational records use dedicated record pages as the site-wide standard.
  Tiles and list rows are clean summaries only.
- Activity bubbles, inline expanded record workspaces, and modal-based record
  workspaces are deprecated. Do not build new operational surfaces around
  them. Use record pages for the primary workspace.
- Modals remain acceptable for narrow confirmations and helper flows, such as
  typed delete confirmation or quick create, when they are not the primary
  record workspace.
- Each operational record page owns fields, on-page editing, Comments,
  attachments, edit history, collapsed Activity log, related sections, and
  future record-specific tools.
- Activity is Podio-style per operational record, with a separate global
  audit/recently deleted surface for deletes.
- Delete events may belong in Notifications Center because they are operational
  exceptions, not routine duplicate noise.
- Activity Log is accessible to all authenticated users and is permission
  filtered server-side. It is not admin-only.
- Comments are user discussion and Activity is system/audit history. Posting a
  comment is not an Activity log event.
- Comments are separate from existing record data fields. In-record narrative
  fields should be labeled `Issues`; reserve `Comments` for the discussion
  layer.
- Comment @mentions are active individual users only, searched by display name.
  Users cannot mention themselves. Mention notifications deep-link to the
  record page, focus Comments, and highlight the mentioned comment.
- Comments support plain text, line breaks, clickable pasted URLs,
  photo/document attachments, author edit/delete anytime, admin delete-any,
  soft-delete placeholders, and visible edit history.
- Admins can view deleted comment contents/history for audit. Normal users see
  `Comment deleted`.
- Activity Layer change/lifecycle events go through `record_activity_event`,
  use `_activity_can_write`, and avoid notification fanout unless explicitly
  requested.
- `record.deleted` and `record.restored` currently mean soft-delete /
  tombstone-preserved records only. Hard-deleted entity visibility needs a
  separate tombstone/deleted-record resolver design.
- Phase 1 Activity event logging is UI-level best-effort unless a lane builds a
  transactional server RPC/trigger that mutates data and records Activity in the
  same transaction.
- Future feature lanes should identify the record/entity being changed, whether
  it needs per-record Activity/comments, how meaningful changes are logged, and
  which Playwright path proves the user workflow.
- Platform hardening should favor shared contracts that let the app grow toward
  300k+ lines without repeated per-surface invention.
- CC should not repitch skipped skill installs: UI UX Pro Max, Impeccable/Taste
  for WCF, Stop Slop, GSD, claude-mem for WCF, OpenSpec.
- `runMutation` caller count is not a success metric. The goal is correct
  write semantics per entity: direct calls for simple saves, `runMutation`
  for routine mutations that want optional Activity logging, SECDEF RPCs for
  audit-critical flows.
- Soft-delete does not require tombstones when the source row remains
  resolver-visible via `deleted_at`. Daily reports prove this model.
- Cattle soft-delete uses the source `cattle` row with `deleted_at` /
  `deleted_by`, not tombstones. Sold/deceased/processed are business states,
  not delete states. Active-herd cattle tag uniqueness remains scoped to
  `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, and `bulls`, and excludes deleted
  rows.
- Tombstones are needed only for true hard-deleted records where source rows
  cannot remain resolver-visible and audit visibility is still required.

## Platform Lane Checklist

Use this checklist when planning any lane that creates, edits, deletes,
restores, completes, reopens, moves, or comments on planner records.

- Name the record/entity being changed, its stable ID, label, route, storage
  source, and permission resolver.
- Operational records need a dedicated record page unless explicitly out of
  scope. Do not add new inline expanded record workspaces or modal-based record
  workspaces.
- Keep Comments separate from Activity and from record `Issues` fields.
- Identify old code/UI being replaced and remove it in the same lane when the
  replacement is validated. If it cannot be removed yet, document why and what
  future proof allows removal.
- Use `runMutation` for routine client-side mutation consistency when it fits,
  but do not treat it as transactional.
- Use a SECDEF RPC/trigger when the data mutation and Activity event must be
  atomic.
- Log meaningful saved user actions; do not log keystrokes or noisy autosave
  ticks.
- Identify the focused Playwright path that proves the user workflow when a
  lane changes mutation behavior or adds a new surface.
- Identify delete behavior and restore expectations before modifying delete
  paths. Consult the Record Identity Map for current per-entity state.
- Identify whether the lane introduces a new unhandled runtime failure mode
  or needs error reporting coverage.
- Choose direct write vs `runMutation` vs SECDEF RPC based on entity risk
  and the Record Identity Map, not helper adoption targets.
- State commit, push, PROD migration, deploy, and docs gates separately.

## Load-Bearing Contracts

Read the relevant contract before editing its files.

### Cross-App

- Do not change Supabase auth config in `src/lib/supabase.js` without a plan.
- Keep `wcfSelectAll`; Supabase `.limit()` silently caps at 1000.
- Keep BrowserRouter view-to-URL adapter unless doing a planned router lane.
- Do not introduce `window.confirm`, `window.alert`, or `window.prompt`.
- Use inline notices, `DeleteModal`, or typed confirmation surfaces.
- Public forms must keep no-auth access where documented.
- Netlify redirect order matters: `equipment.html` rules before SPA fallback.
- No migrations, RLS, Vault, Edge Function deploys, or production data actions
  without Ronnie's explicit gate from [HO.md](HO.md).

### Supabase And Storage

- Never delete directly from `storage.objects`; use Storage API list/remove
  recursion.
- Private buckets are read through signed URLs.
- Task photo uploads are append-only (`upsert:false`); duplicate object errors
  are retry success.
- Admin-created user emails, welcome emails, and password resets are sent by
  `rapid-processor` from `noreply@wcfplanner.com`.
- PROD `exec_sql` is forbidden.

### Tasks

- `/tasks` is canonical.
- Task writes go through v2 wrappers/RPCs only.
- Do not directly update `task_instances` or task sidecar tables from UI code.
- Do not call `generate_system_task_instance` from frontend code.
- `task_instance_photos` is canonical; legacy single-path columns are fallback
  display only.
- Header task badge soft-fails to zero and must not break Header rendering.
- Task assignee dropdowns use `loadTaskAssignableProfilesById` and fail closed
  on config read errors.

### Notifications

- Client cannot insert/delete notifications.
- Notification writes happen inside SECURITY DEFINER paths.
- Recipient-only RLS: users can select/update only their own rows.
- Recipient UPDATE grant is column-scoped to `read_at`.
- `complete_task_instance` notification insert must never roll back the task
  completion.
- Skip task-completed notification when creator is null or completer is creator.
- Valid `notifications.type`: `task_completed`, `mention`, `comment_mention`.
  New types require a migration that widens the CHECK.
- Header bell soft-fails to zero and must not break Header rendering.

### Activity, Comments, And Mentions

- Activity and Comments are separate contracts.
- Activity is system/audit history only. Comments are user discussion only.
- Activity reads/writes go through SECURITY DEFINER RPCs:
  `list_activity_events`, `count_activity_for_entity`,
  `list_global_activity`, `record_activity_event`, plus legacy comment RPCs
  until each entity migrates off the old Activity comment model.
- Legacy comment RPCs `post_activity_comment`, `edit_activity_event`, and
  `delete_activity_event` exist for current compact-chip / ActivityModal
  surfaces. Do not use them for new operational record pages.
- Remove legacy Activity comment RPCs only after no remaining entity uses
  compact chips or ActivityModal for comments and all related deep-links/tests
  have migrated to record pages.
- New record pages use the Comments foundation tables/APIs, not
  `activity_events`, for comment storage.
- Comments APIs/RPCs are expected to include `list_comments`,
  `count_comments`, `post_comment`, `edit_comment`, `delete_comment`, and
  `list_comment_edits`.
- No direct `.from('activity_events')`, `.from('activity_mentions')`,
  `.from('comments')`, or `.from('comment_edits')` in `src`; use the approved
  API/RPC layer.
- `_activity_can_read(entity_type, entity_id)` is fail-closed. Entity existence
  is checked before role shortcuts; admin does not bypass fake-id rejection.
- Supported entity types are: `task.instance`, `broiler.batch`, `pig.batch`,
  `layer.batch`, `layer.housing`, `cattle.animal`, `cattle.processing`,
  `sheep.animal`, `sheep.processing`, `equipment.item`, `poultry.daily`,
  `layer.daily`, `egg.daily`, `pig.daily`, `cattle.daily`, `sheep.daily`,
  `weighin.session`.
- New entity type = one permission resolver branch, one registry entry,
  stable record route/deep-link mapping, one record page surface, and a
  mutation/error/activity plan that uses `runMutation` or a SECDEF RPC where
  appropriate.
- `/activity` is a permission-filtered global audit timeline backed by
  `list_global_activity`; it must never bypass `_activity_can_read`.
- `record_activity_event` event types are server-allowlisted:
  `field.updated`, `status.changed`, `record.created`, `record.deleted`,
  `record.restored`. New event types require a migration.
- `record.deleted` and `record.restored` require the source entity to still
  exist for `_activity_can_read` / `_activity_can_write`; hard-delete audit
  visibility needs a tombstone/deleted-record design.
- Meaningful change logging must avoid keystroke/autosave noise. Prefer saved
  user actions such as notes/status/date/location/count changes.
- Pilot Activity change logging writes data first and records Activity
  best-effort. Security-critical or audit-critical paths should move toward
  server RPCs/triggers that mutate data and insert Activity in one transaction.
- Mentions store identity by profile ID. Visible body stays user-friendly
  plain `@Name`; UUIDs must not appear in body text.
- Server validates mentions: profile exists, profile active, display-name
  matched, caller can comment, and mentioned profile is not the caller.
- Mention notifications deep-link to the operational record page and identify
  the target comment so the page can focus/highlight it.
- Comment delete is soft-delete only. Authors can delete their own comments;
  admins can delete any comment. Admins cannot edit another user's comment.
- If a SECDEF RPC return shape changes, migration must end with
  `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`.

### Entity Mutations

- `runMutation` in `src/lib/entityMutations.js` is the shared helper for
  routine client-side mutation consistency: run mutation, check error, optionally
  record Activity after success, and return `{ok, data}` or `{ok, error}`.
- `runMutation` must stay small. It must not know table names, business rules,
  entity-specific permissions, or UI components.
- `mutateFn` must return a Supabase-style `{data, error}` object. Undefined,
  null, or non-object returns are caller bugs and should fail.
- `runMutation` must never record Activity when the mutation failed.
- `runMutation` is not transactional. If the mutation succeeds and Activity
  logging fails, the data change is already committed.
- Use server-side SECDEF RPCs/triggers for audit-critical flows where mutation
  and Activity must succeed or fail together, especially delete/restore and
  lifecycle/status transitions.
- New routine save paths should prefer `runMutation` when it fits, while keeping
  domain logic in the caller.

### Daily Reports

- Add Feed quick-log rows can share daily tables but are not a substitute for a
  full daily report. Missed-report checks exclude `source='add_feed_webform'`.
- Duplicate prevention target:
  - poultry/pig/layer: `(date, batch_label)`
  - cattle: `(date, herd)`
  - sheep: `(date, flock)`
  - partial indexes exclude Add Feed rows
  - `egg_dailys`: warning/pre-submit guard only, no hard unique index yet
- Existing PROD duplicate cleanup is required before applying migration `059`.
- Daily reports use soft-delete via `soft_delete_daily_report` /
  `restore_daily_report` SECDEF RPCs. `soft_delete_daily_report` is available
  to any active authenticated role; `restore_daily_report` remains admin-only.
  All daily table reads filter `.is('deleted_at', null)`. Admin Recently Deleted
  tab shows deleted reports with restore. No hard-delete path remains for dailys.
- Delete button visibility across all 6 daily views follows
  `canDeleteDailyReport(authState)`: any truthy role except `inactive`.
- `dailyDuplicateCheck.js` excludes soft-deleted records from duplicate checks.
- Daily Report Record Pages are live for all 6 authenticated daily entities.
  They preserve the existing soft-delete/restore contracts, move per-record
  discussion to `CommentsSection`, keep Activity as collapsed audit history,
  retire daily Activity chips/modal UI, and open directly editable without a
  separate edit-mode button.
- Home missed-report logic includes pig feeder groups plus active SOWS/BOARS
  breeding-stock groups derived from non-archived pig breeders.

### Pig

- Feeder group started counts are authoritative.
- Current count is ledger-derived, not persisted `currentCount`.
- Planned-trip row shape stays exactly:
  `{id, date, sex, subBatchId, plannedCount, order}`.
- Lock state lives only in `ppp-pig-planned-trip-locks-v1`.
- `processingTrips[].subAttributions` must be stamped as
  `{subId, subBatchName, sex, count}`.
- Send-to-Trip from `/weigh-in-sessions/<id>` may reconcile a locked planned
  trip count, but cannot change the locked date. `/pig/weighins` is a list and
  navigation surface.
- Use `pigSlug` for sub-batch matching.

### Broiler And Layers

- Broiler batches live in `ppp-v4`.
- Public `/weighins` cannot read or mutate `app_store.ppp-v4` directly.
- Public week 4/6 completion uses `stamp_broiler_batch_avg` RPC.
- Do not grant anon direct `app_store` access.
- Admin weigh-in paths may use authenticated `app_store` helpers.
- Layer `current_count` is physical anchor; projected count subtracts
  mortalities since anchor.

### Feed Planning

- Feed math lives in `src/lib/feedPlanner.js`; views should not rebuild it.
- `LEAD_TIME_DAYS = 7`, `RESERVE_DAYS.default = 30`,
  `ORDER_ROUNDING_LBS = 50`, `STALE_SNAPSHOT_DAYS = 21`.
- Feed types: `pig`, `starter`, `grower`, `layerfeed`.
- Snapshot counts are anchors; today's on-hand subtracts consumption since the
  snapshot date.
- Poultry burn uses existing broiler/layer schedule helpers.

### Cattle And Sheep

- Cattle and sheep use dedicated Supabase tables, not `app_store`.
- Cattle herds: `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, `bulls`.
- Sheep flocks: `rams`, `ewes`, `feeders`.
- Cattle animal delete/restore is admin-only through
  `soft_delete_cattle_animal` / `restore_cattle_animal`; clients have no direct
  cattle DELETE policy.
- Normal cattle read surfaces filter `deleted_at IS NULL`. Admin Recently
  Deleted surfaces may read deleted cattle through admin-gated RLS.
- Cattle active-herd tag uniqueness is `tag` where `deleted_at IS NULL` and
  herd is one of `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, `bulls`.
- Sold/deceased/processed cattle are not delete states; they remain active
  records for delete/restore purposes.
- Processing batch detail may resolve a deleted cow by ID in admin context; do
  not add a `deleted_at` filter to `src/lib/cattleProcessingBatch.js` unless
  that workflow is redesigned.
- Cattle processing storage statuses remain `scheduled`, `active`, `complete`;
  UI may label `complete` as Processed.
- Cattle move only when Send-to-Processor promotes a row to `active`.
- `loadCattleWeighInsCached` keeps the two-query pattern. Do not rewrite to
  `!inner`.
- Old cattle tag source strings are load-bearing: `import`, `weigh_in`,
  `manual`.

### Cattle And Sheep Inputs

- Admin panel: `src/admin/LivestockFeedInputsPanel.jsx`.
- Public/new-record dropdowns hide only `status === 'inactive'`; legacy
  blank/null status remains selectable.
- Daily edit/history surfaces must load inactive referenced inputs for snapshot
  rebuilding; filter inactive rows at dropdown render sites, not load time.

### Equipment

- Logged-in Equipment: `/fleet`.
- Public equipment/fueling: `/equipment` and `/equipment/<slug>`.
- Public fueling uses `submit_equipment_fueling` RPC.
- Fuel-log edit/delete paths recompute current readings from remaining fuel logs.
- Equipment checklist/material textboxes must not reload, lose focus, or reorder
  list items on click/edit.
- Rolling materials clears are bucketed by due service cycle.

### Icons

- Use `public/icons/planner` through `PlannerIcon` or `plannerIconUrl`.
- App code must not reference `C:\Users\Ronni\OneDrive\Desktop\planner pics`.
- Do not put images inside `<option>` elements; use text fallback there.
