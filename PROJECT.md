## Current Build State

### Shipped

| Area | Current state |
|---|---|
| Core app | Vite + React 18 SPA, BrowserRouter with view-to-URL adapter, Netlify production from `main`. |
| Public webforms | `/dailys`, `/addfeed`, `/weighins`, `/equipment`, `/equipment/supply`, `/dailys/tasks`. Legacy aliases remain. |
| Logged-in equipment | `/fleet`, `/fleet/<slug>`, `/fleet/fuel-log`, `/fleet/materials`. Public `/equipment/<slug>` is not a logged-in fleet route. |
| Tasks v2 | T1-T11 complete and deployed. `/tasks` is canonical. `/my-tasks` and `/admin/tasks` redirect to `/tasks`. Header has the single Tasks destination. Weekly digest uses the v2 template and shared cron-secret rapid-processor auth. |
| Task assignees | Task Center mutation dropdowns use `tasks_public_assignee_availability`. Hidden profiles are excluded from New Task/Reassign/Recurring/System Rule modals. Read-only history/group labels still display hidden or inactive names when already assigned. |
| Header | Dark bar groups Dailys + Equipment under "Webforms"; Equipment routes to public `/equipment`. Tasks is visually separated from webform links. |
| Planner icons | `public/icons/planner/*.png` supplies program/action/equipment icons. Use `PlannerIcon`, `PlannerIconLabel`, and `plannerIconUrl`; do not reference the OneDrive source folder in app code. |
| Pig planned trips | `/pig/batches` supports admin/management add/delete/move/date-step planned trips, plus lock/unlock via a sidecar key (`ppp-pig-planned-trip-locks-v1`). Locked trips reject manual date/count/add/delete edits in `/pig/batches`. `/pig/weighins` Send-to-Trip fulfillment still reconciles `plannedCount`/removal against a locked trip without changing the scheduled date. Farm team is read-only on planned/processing trip mutations. |
| Pig processor controls | Completed pig weigh-in sessions still expose processor-send controls for authorized users when unsent entries exist. |
| Cattle processing workflow | Planned (virtual forecast) → Scheduled (`status='scheduled'`, processor date booked) → Active (Send-to-Processor promotes scheduled or creates fresh) → Processed (UI label; `status='complete'` in storage). Migration 054 widened the status CHECK to include `'scheduled'`. |
| Layer dashboard | Main layer dashboard shows lifetime active-batch cost metrics. Layer group/batch detail views keep their own metrics. |
| Equipment admin | Equipment checklist/materials text edits preserve focus and do not reload/reorder the screen on every textbox click. Drag reorder and checklist rows remain stable. |
| Feed planner | `/pig/feed` and `/broiler/feed` ship as minimal ledger screens backed by `src/lib/feedPlanner.js`. Pig view shows four top tiles plus active-month workflow; poultry view shows Starter / Grower / Layer Feed as separate tile stacks. Active month + most recently saved month stay expanded; older saved months collapse. Save advances to the next month; physical-count snapshots anchor the math. |
| Broiler public weigh-ins | Public `/weighins` (anon) cannot read `app_store.ppp-v4` under RLS. Week 4/6 completion stamps `week4Lbs`/`week6Lbs` on the matching batch through the `stamp_broiler_batch_avg` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (migration 055). Public form file is statically locked against `app_store`/`ppp-v4` literals and against importing `writeBroilerBatchAvg`. |

### Active Roadmap

1. **Project-wide browser-dialog cleanup.** Start with destructive `window.confirm` / `confirm` / `window.prompt` flows; replace with `DeleteModal`, inline two-step, or typed confirmation. Informational `window.alert` cleanup is a separate follow-up pass.
2. **CI flake hardening.** Latest verified blocker: main CI run `25736097941` on `0226c41` failed at `tests/cattle_forecast.spec.js:785` with `locator.click: Timeout 10000ms exceeded`. Local pass on the same SHA. Re-check the run before fixing — env race or selector-stability candidate, not a confirmed code defect.
3. **Script/archive hygiene.** Audit `scripts/` references against `package.json`, `.github`, `tests`, `src`, `PROJECT.md`, and `HO.md`; archive confirmed one-shot/manual scripts into `scripts/archive/` with a short README. Separate commit, not bundled with docs or feature lanes.
4. **Incremental lint/test hygiene.** Touched-file warning cleanup, skipped-test review (incl. the two `.skip` bodies in `tests/cattle_send_to_processor.spec.js`), no broad churn pass without explicit approval.

## Roles And Permissions

| Role | General capability |
|---|---|
| `farm_team` | Read most assigned program surfaces; edit/delete own daily reports only; read-only for pig planned/processing trip mutations. |
| `management` | Edit operational records; delete daily reports; can mutate pig planned/processing trip surfaces. |
| `admin` | Full app access; deletes, admin panels, Tasks system/admin controls, user management. |
| `equipment_tech` | Equipment-only access. Logged-in `/fleet` sub-nav hides the Fleet, Fuel Log, and Materials admin lists and exposes per-equipment tabs. Detail pages show Manuals & Videos, upcoming service, and fueling/checklist history; maintenance events and admin surfaces are hidden. |
| `inactive` | Not an eligible active user. |

Per-program access uses `profiles.program_access`. Null/empty means all programs. Admins always bypass program restrictions.

Known admin profiles in production:

| Person | Profile/email note |
|---|---|
| Ronnie | `ronnie@whitecreek.farm` is the admin profile. |
| Isabel | `isabel@sonnysfarm.com` is an admin profile. |
| Mak | Management. |
| Simon | Farm team. |

Do not treat `byronronniejones@gmail.com` as the Ronnie admin profile for Tasks assignee logic. It has been used as an inbox/test address and should not bypass the profile/availability rules.

|---|---|
| `profiles` | Users, roles, program access. Hand-created prod table, no migration owns the initial create. |
| `app_store` | JSON blob store for most non-daily structured app data. Hand-created prod table. |
| `webform_config` | Public form config and availability. Hand-created prod table. |
| `poultry_dailys`, `layer_dailys`, `egg_dailys`, `pig_dailys` | Daily reports. Hand-created prod tables. `pig_dailys` has no `feed_type` column. |
| `layer_batches`, `layer_housings` | Layer batch/housing model. Hand-created prod tables. |
| `weigh_in_sessions`, `weigh_ins` | Shared weigh-ins for cattle, sheep, pig, broiler. |
| `cattle*` | Cattle module tables, comments, forecast, processing, feed tests/inputs. |
| `sheep`, `sheep_lambing_records`, `sheep_processing_batches`, `sheep_transfers` | Sheep module. |

## Domain State

### Feed Planning

Current UI (`/pig/feed` and `/broiler/feed`):

- Minimal monthly ledger backed by `src/lib/feedPlanner.js`.
- Four top tiles in this order: **Actual On Hand**, **End of [prev] Est.**, **Order for [active]**, **Need Thru [active+1]**. Pig has a single stack; poultry repeats the same four-tile pattern per feed type (Starter, Grower, Layer Feed).
- Active month is always expanded with an editable Ordered/Delivered row. Save commits the row and advances the active month forward.
- Most-recently-saved non-active month stays expanded with an Edit affordance. All older saved months collapse into a drill-down list.
- Physical count input stamps `todayDate` on save; the operator cannot backdate from the UI. The "Count includes [month] order" checkbox writes `includesCurrentMonthDelivery` on the snapshot row so the math knows whether the current month's delivery is already inside the operator's count.
- Stale-count banner appears after 21 days without a fresh physical count.
- Pig view also surfaces a static "Feed Rate Reference" panel (sow/boar/nursing rates) at the bottom of the screen.

Helper contracts (`src/lib/feedPlanner.js`):

- `LEAD_TIME_DAYS = 7`.
- `RESERVE_DAYS = {default: 30}`.
- `ORDER_ROUNDING_LBS = 50`.
- `STALE_SNAPSHOT_DAYS = 21`.
- Feed types: `pig`, `starter`, `grower`, `layerfeed`.
- Days of runway walks forward day-by-day; never use `onHand / todayBurn`.
- Snapshot counts are anchors: today's on-hand = snapshot lbs minus consumption since snapshot date.
- Pig feeder count is ledger-derived through pig helpers (parent-only math), not persisted `currentCount`.
- Poultry projection uses existing broiler/layer schedule helpers: `getFeedSchedule`, `LAYER_FEED_SCHEDULE`, `LAYER_FEED_PER_DAY`, `computeProjectedCount`.

### Tasks v2

Tasks v2 is complete and canonical at `/tasks`.

Functional surfaces:

- Header Tasks button and due/past-due badge for the logged-in user.
- My Tasks tab: own open tasks plus grouped visible open tasks.
- Recurring tab: template groups, admin CRUD.
- Completed tab: completed rows, notes, assignee/completed-by names, photo lightbox.
- System Tasks tab: admin-only view of built-in system rules, admin rule edits.
- New Task modal, Complete Task modal, due-date edit modal, assign/delete modals.
- Photo sidecar lightbox with signed URLs.
- Weekly digest rebranded to Tasks v2 and verified in production.

Mutation paths:

- Use v2 SECDEF RPC wrappers from `tasksCenterMutationsApi.js`.
- Do not directly update `task_instances` from UI code.
- Do not call `generate_system_task_instance` from frontend code.
- Task-assignee mutation dropdowns use `loadTaskAssignableProfilesById`.
- Read-only display maps may use the unfiltered eligible-profile map so stranded historical assignments still render by name.

Routes:

- `/tasks` is canonical.
- `/my-tasks` and `/admin/tasks` are aliases only.
- Deleted legacy components should not be reintroduced.

### Pig

Core model:

- Feeder group started counts are authoritative.
- Sub-batches partition parent gilt/boar counts and are single-sex.
- Current count is ledger-derived: started minus processing-trip sub-attributions, breeding transfers, and mortality.
- Processing trips originate from weigh-ins via Send-to-Trip (pig terminology); cattle/sheep use Send-to-Processor.
- `processingTrips[].subAttributions` must be stamped as `{subId, subBatchName, sex, count}`.

Planned trips:

- Persisted planned-trip shape is exactly `{id, date, sex, subBatchId, plannedCount, order}`. Lock state lives in the `ppp-pig-planned-trip-locks-v1` sidecar, never on the trip row.
- Derived projection/warning/ready fields are not persisted.
- Admin/management can add, delete, move counts, date-step, lock, and unlock planned trips.
- Delete reconciles count to next trip, falling back to previous.
- Move forward moves the lightest pig from current to next; move back moves the heaviest pig from current to previous.
- First trip cannot move backward; last trip cannot move forward; middle trips can move either way.
- Locks block manual date/count/add/delete edits in `/pig/batches`. Send-to-Trip fulfillment from `/pig/weighins` is NOT lock-gated — it can reconcile `plannedCount` and removals against a locked trip but cannot change the scheduled date.
- `/pig/weighins` sends selected pigs to the next planned trip in that chain and reconciles exact, under-pull, residual, over-pull, and exhausted-chain cases.

Slug rule:

- Always use `pigSlug` for sub-batch matching. Do not hand-type dashed variants such as `p-26-01-a`.

### Broiler And Layers

Broiler:

- Batches live in `ppp-v4`.
- Feed schedules live in `src/lib/broiler.js`.
- Week 4/6 weigh-ins write averages back to batch records (`week4Lbs`/`week6Lbs`) when sessions complete.
- Public `/weighins` (anon) cannot read `app_store.ppp-v4` under RLS. On the read side, `broiler_batch_meta` in `webform_config` is the public source (see `src/lib/broilerBatchMeta.js`). On the write side, week 4/6 public completion calls the `stamp_broiler_batch_avg` SECURITY DEFINER RPC from migration 055; the public form file is statically locked against `app_store`/`ppp-v4` literals and against importing `writeBroilerBatchAvg`.
- Admin paths (`LivestockWeighInsView`) still call `writeBroilerBatchAvg` and `recomputeBroilerBatchWeekAvg` directly because authenticated has SELECT/UPDATE on `app_store`. The admin helper coerces `broiler_week` via `Number()` so JSON-roundtripped sessions still gate correctly.

Layers:

- `layer_batches` and `layer_housings` are the current layer model.
- `current_count` is a physical anchor; projected count subtracts mortalities since anchor.
- Main Layer dashboard now shows lifetime active-batch cost metrics only.
- Do not duplicate the same metric block when a batch has only one housing.

### Cattle

- Dedicated Supabase tables, not `app_store`.
- Herds: `mommas`, `backgrounders`, `finishers`, `bulls`; outcomes: `processed`, `deceased`, `sold`.
- Cattle processing batch workflow: Planned (virtual forecast) → Scheduled (`status='scheduled'`, processor date booked, cattle remain forecast-eligible) → Active (Send-to-Processor promotes or creates) → Processed (UI label; storage value stays `status='complete'`).
- Scheduled batches never update `cattle.herd` or `cattle.processing_batch_id` — cattle move only when Send-to-Processor flips a row to `active`. Migration 054 added `'scheduled'` to the status CHECK alongside `'active'` and `'complete'`.
- Cattle processing batches enter `active` either by Send-to-Processor promoting a matching scheduled row OR creating a fresh active row when no scheduled match exists. UI surfaces "Processed" for `status='complete'` rows — DB value is unchanged so RPC + JS comparisons stay stable.
- `loadCattleWeighInsCached` uses the two-query pattern. No `!inner` join rewrite.
- Old tag source strings are load-bearing: `import`, `weigh_in`, `manual`.

### Sheep

- Dedicated sheep tables plus shared weigh-in tables.
- Flocks: `rams`, `ewes`, `feeders`; outcomes: `processed`, `deceased`, `sold`.
- Sheep processing mirrors cattle but has looser Send-to-Processor gating: draft sessions from any flock.

### Equipment And Fuel

- Logged-in Equipment lives under `/fleet`.
- Public equipment/fueling lives under `/equipment`.
- Fuel supplied to farm is `fuel_supplies`; fuel consumed by equipment is `equipment_fuelings`.
- Public fueling uses `submit_equipment_fueling` RPC to insert fueling and bump current reading atomically.
- Materials checklist data lives in `equipment_service_materials` and `equipment_material_clears`.
- Equipment admin checklist/material textboxes must be one-click editable with no reload/focus loss/list reorder.

## Load-Bearing Contracts

Read this section before editing related files.

### Cross-App

- Do not change Supabase auth config in `src/lib/supabase.js` without a migration plan.
- Keep `wcfSelectAll` pagination pattern. `.limit()` silently caps at 1000.
- Keep BrowserRouter view-to-URL adapter unless doing a planned full router migration.
- Keep `\u` JSX escape literals where they already exist.
- Do not introduce `window.confirm`, `window.alert`, or `window.prompt` for destructive flows; use typed confirmation modals.
- Use `DeleteModal` for deletes.
- Public forms must keep no-auth access where documented.
- Netlify redirect order matters: `equipment.html` rules before SPA fallback.

### Supabase And Storage

- Never delete directly from `storage.objects`; use Storage API list/remove recursion.
- Private buckets must be read through signed URLs.
- Task photo uploads are append-only (`upsert:false`), and duplicate object errors are retry success.
- No migrations, RLS, Vault, or Edge Function deploys without explicit gates from Ronnie.

### Tasks

- Task Center writes go through v2 wrappers/RPCs only.
- Do not directly write task sidecar tables from the frontend.
- `task_instance_photos` is canonical; legacy single-path columns are compatibility display fallback.
- Header badge must soft-fail to zero and never break Header rendering.
- Task Center assignee dropdowns must respect `tasks_public_assignee_availability` and fail closed on config read errors.
- System task generation stays in cron/Edge Function flow, not frontend.

### Pig

- Planned trips persist exactly six keys: `id`, `date`, `sex`, `subBatchId`, `plannedCount`, `order`. Lock state must NEVER be added to this shape; it lives in the `ppp-pig-planned-trip-locks-v1` sidecar.
- `ppp-feeders-v1` remains the planned/processing trip persistence key.
- `ppp-pig-global-adg-v1` shape remains `{manualValue, updatedAt, updatedBy}`.
- `processingTrips[].subAttributions` is required for attribution-aware ledger math.
- `weigh_ins.sent_to_trip_id` and `sent_to_group_id` must be stamped on processor send.
- Farm team cannot mutate planned/processing trip state.
- Locked planned trips reject manual date/count/add/delete edits in `/pig/batches`. `/pig/weighins` Send-to-Trip fulfillment is NOT gated by the lock — it can reconcile `plannedCount`/removal against a locked trip, but cannot change the scheduled date.

### Broiler

- Public `/weighins` must not import `writeBroilerBatchAvg` and must not contain `app_store`/`ppp-v4` literals. The static lock at `tests/static/weighinswebform_no_app_store.test.js` enforces both.
- Public week 4/6 completion must route through `sb.rpc('stamp_broiler_batch_avg', {session_id_in})` (migration 055). The RPC is `SECURITY DEFINER`, strict `status='complete'`, takes `FOR UPDATE` on the `ppp-v4` row, and returns `applied:false` (not RAISE) for benign no-ops.
- No new direct GRANTs on `app_store` for anon. The RPC is the only anon-reachable surface that mutates the broiler batch store.

### Feed

- Feed order logic uses `feedPlanner.js`; views must not rebuild separate math.
- Pig count derives from ledger helpers, not stored/current UI fields.
- Poultry burn stays tied to existing broiler/layer schedule helpers.
- Active month is always editable; saved months are read-only unless the most recently saved non-active month is opened via the Edit affordance.
- `ppp-feed-orders-v1` per-row keys persist as written (`starter`, `grower`, `layerfeed` for poultry; `pig` for pig).
- `includesCurrentMonthDelivery` is a live snapshot-row flag, written by the "Count includes [month] order" checkbox in the minimal ledger. Helpers must keep treating it as load-bearing and stay tolerant of legacy rows that already carry it.

### Equipment

- Public `/equipment/<slug>` remains public checklist/fueling; logged-in detail is `/fleet/<slug>`.
- Equipment admin text inputs must not reload the screen, lose cursor focus, or reorder list items on click/edit.
- Rolling materials clears are bucketed by due service cycle; do not collapse them into a single permanent hide flag.

### Icons

- Use `public/icons/planner` through `PlannerIcon`/`plannerIconUrl`.
- App code must not reference `C:\Users\Ronni\OneDrive\Desktop\planner pics`.
- Do not put images inside `<option>` elements; use text fallback there.

Use [HO.md](HO.md) for the required floor and gate sequence. Common commands:

```bash
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

Focused examples:

```bash
npx vitest run src/lib/feedPlanner.test.js
npx playwright test tests/pig_send_to_planned_trip.spec.js
npx playwright test tests/tasks_v2_t8_t9_admin_controls.spec.js
```

Current lint baseline is warnings-only. Do not add errors. When changing a lane, touched files should be warning-clean unless the repo has an established JSX false-positive pattern with an inline rationale.
